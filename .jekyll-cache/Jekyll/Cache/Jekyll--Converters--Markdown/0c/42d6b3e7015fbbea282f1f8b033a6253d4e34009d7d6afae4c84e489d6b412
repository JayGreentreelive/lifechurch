<p class="lead">Think back through Craig’s message. What sticks out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p>￼<em>It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.</em><br />
John 13:1-2</p>

<p><em>So [Jesus] got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</em><br />
John 13:4-5</p>

<p><em>The greatest among you will be your servant.</em><br />
Matthew 23:11</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone has some kind of feeling about feet—what’s yours?</li>
  <li>What’s the nastiest, smelliest thing you’ve ever cleaned up?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe someone who serves you. What impact do they have on your life?</li>
  <li>Why do you think Jesus used some of His last hours alive to wash dirty feet?</li>
  <li>Read Matthew 23:11. How does this scripture make you feel about the people you interact with each day?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk about a time you experienced the value of service.</li>
  <li>Do you serve at Life.Church or in your community? How have your family, work, passion, and relationships been affected?</li>
  <li>Compare times in your life where you’ve been more involved and less involved in service. What patterns do you notice?</li>
  <li>If you’re not currently serving, where do you think God could use you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about service.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.20.35.niv">Acts 20:35</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.5.13-14.niv">Galatians 5:13-14</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.4.10-11.niv">1 Peter 4:10-11</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mrk.10.44-45.niv">Mark 10:44-45</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p>Jesus, You were there when life was spoken into being, yet You spent Your life in service. Will You teach us to serve others the way You have served us? Holy Spirit, tug each of our hearts toward the people You want us to serve. Amen</p>
