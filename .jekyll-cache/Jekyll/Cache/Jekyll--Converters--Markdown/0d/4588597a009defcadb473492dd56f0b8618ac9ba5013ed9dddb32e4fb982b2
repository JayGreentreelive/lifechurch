<p class="lead">Start your discussion by reviewing this week’s key points.</p>

<p>This week’s text is Daniel 3 and 1 Peter 1:7.</p>

<p>A faith that is <strong>tested</strong> is a faith that can be <strong>trusted</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="three-qualities-of-standing-in-faith">Three qualities of standing in faith</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Faith obeys God instead of following man. <em>“If you’re committed to serving God, your spiritual enemy will give you ample opportunities to compromise your commitment.”</em></li>
  <li>Faith <strong>believes</strong> in spite of what it <strong>sees</strong>. <em>My faith says, ‘My God is willing and able!’”</em></li>
  <li>Faithful <strong>obedience</strong> is our responsibility. <strong>Outcome</strong> is God’s.</li>
</ol>
