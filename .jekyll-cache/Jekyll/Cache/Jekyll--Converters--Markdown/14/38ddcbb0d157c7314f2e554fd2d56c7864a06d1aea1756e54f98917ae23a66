<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p>The Story of John the Baptist<br />
Mark 6:17-19, 26-28</p>

<p><em>When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask [Jesus], ‚ÄúAre you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?‚Äù Jesus replied, ‚ÄúGo back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.‚Äù</em><br />
Matthew 11:2-6 NIV</p>

<p><em>Many are the plans in a person‚Äôs heart, but it is the LORD‚Äôs purpose that prevails.</em><br />
Proverbs 19:21 NIV</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>John the Baptist ate what? What‚Äôs the nastiest thing you‚Äôve ever eaten.</li>
  <li>Do you have a funny story of finding out someone wasn‚Äôt really listening? Bad phone connection, headphones in, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did anything from the message change the way you think about God? How?</li>
  <li>Why do you think God doesn‚Äôt always intervene when we think He should?</li>
  <li>Do you think John the Baptist‚Äôs desires were ultimately fulfilled by Jesus? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Read Proverbs 19:21. What does it mean to you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share a story about when God was silent. How did it turn out?</li>
  <li>Have difficult situations in your life changed your view of God? If so, how?</li>
  <li>If you were certain God would use the hard thing you are facing for good, how would that change your perspective?</li>
  <li>Do you have any perspectives of God that are inconsistent with the Bible?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>God we don‚Äôt always understand You, but we want to always trust You. Will You increase our faith and trust in You? Jesus, thank You for sharing in our pain on the cross. Amen.</li>
</ul>
