<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Facilitate discussion that engages everyone. Choose questions that will lead each person to own their own growth.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which season is your favorite (like the actual weather)?</li>
  <li>What season are you in (like the seasons Craig described)? How can you embrace the season you’re in?</li>
  <li>What do you need to pursue or protect?</li>
  <li>What are your experiences with relational intimacy (meaning complete transparency) Craig talked about? Why do you think that kind of closeness is harder for some people than others?</li>
  <li>Did you have any examples of a good, godly marriage when you were growing up? How have those early impressions shaped your outlook on marriage?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>What do you need to limit right now — time, talk, or touch?</li>
  <li>What reflections have you had over the past week about last week’s qualities to develop and look for? (Godly character, growing trust, higher standards, consistent encouragement)</li>
  <li>What are your thoughts about marriage in general? What about for yourself specifically?</li>
  <li>What is easy for you to embrace in your current season of life? What things are more difficult for you in this season?</li>
  <li>What standards have you set (or will you set) to help protect the purity of your relationships?</li>

<ul>
  <li>What’s one thing your spouse does that makes you feel close?</li>
  <li>What would take your marriage beyond just sharing space and stuff? What would bring you closer to true intimacy?</li>
  <li>How have you protected the purity of your relationship? What are some ways you could improve that together in the future?</li>
  <li>What does it feel like to know you belong to your spouse? What’s nice about that? What’s hard about that for you?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What will you do to build healthy intimacy with the people you’re close to? What will you do to be truly transparent?</li>
