  <li>Share a time when an unmet expectation made you a lot angrier than it should have.</li>
  <li>How does self-centeredness play into the things you fight about? Share examples and talk about how it could have been handled in a more others-focused way.</li>
  <li>How aware of your own self-centeredness do you think you are? How could you get a more objective view of it?</li>
