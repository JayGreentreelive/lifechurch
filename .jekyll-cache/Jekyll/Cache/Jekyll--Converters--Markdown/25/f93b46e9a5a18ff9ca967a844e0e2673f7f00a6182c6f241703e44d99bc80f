<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.3.14-21.niv">Ephesians 3:14-21</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.1.3.niv">Ephesians 1:3</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/php.4.19.niv">Philippians 4:19</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2cor.4.16.niv">2 Corinthians 4:16</a></p>

<p><em>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.</em><br /> <strong>- Ephesians 3:16-17 NIV</strong></p>

<h3 id="two-big-prayer-mistakes">Two Big Prayer Mistakes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Our prayers are too small.<br />
<em>‚ÄúFeeling small? Start praying big!‚Äù</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our prayers are too general.<br />
<em>‚ÄúGeneral prayers don‚Äôt move God to specific actions.‚Äù</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Tell a story of a time when you prayed a big prayer and you saw God answer in a big way.</li>
  <li>If God answered all of your prayers last week, how would your life and others‚Äô lives look different? In other words, you pray ‚Äúso that,‚Äù what?</li>
  <li>Have you sensed God‚Äôs power, direction, or love more strongly during a time of prayer? Share your experience.</li>
  <li>What will you pray for with power this week? Be specific.</li>
