<p class="lead">Start with an easy question everyone can answer. Then move through the questions you feel will lead your group to action.</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œAh, just let â€˜em soak!â€ or, â€œThereâ€™s no time like the present!â€ When it comes to doing dishes, which type are you?</li>
  <li>Have you ever â€œscared away the fawnsâ€ because you shared a compliment that backfired? What was the result?</li>
  <li>Is it harder for you to give or receive words of affirmation? What makes it so difficult for you?</li>
  <li>What are some intentions you havenâ€™t turned into actions? How could you close that gap?</li>
</ul>

</ul>
