<p>Key Scripture</p>

<p><em>“For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.”</em><br />
1 Timothy 6:10 NIV</p>

<h3 id="biblical-context">Biblical Context</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ecc.5.10.niv">Ecclesiastes 5:10 </a></li>
  <li>But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.<br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1ti.6.8-10.niv">1 Timothy 6:8-10</a></li>
  <li>Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.<br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1ti.6.17.niv">1 Timothy 6:17</a></li>
</ul>

  <li>Have you thought about how much more you would need to feel secure? What does that show you about your heart?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read 1 Timothy 6:6-19 aloud together. Which part is most convicting to you personally? Share why it sticks out to you.</li>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>God, it’s so tempting to fall in love with money and the things it promises. Help us to seek that provision only from You. We trust You alone for our contentment and security. Help us to seek significance from You and not our possessions. Forgive us for the ways we’ve let that dangerous love grow in our hearts.</li>
