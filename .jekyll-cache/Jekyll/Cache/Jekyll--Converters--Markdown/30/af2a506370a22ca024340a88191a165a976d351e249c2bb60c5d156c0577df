I"c<p class="lead">Think back to Craig's message. What‚Äôs sticking with you?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>I don‚Äôt really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don‚Äôt do it. Instead, I do what I hate‚Ä¶ I want to do what is right, but I can‚Äôt. I want to do what is good, but I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway‚Ä¶ Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death? Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord.</em><br />
Romans 7:15, 18b-19, 24-25 NLT</p>

<p><em>Don‚Äôt you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.</em><br />
1 Corinthians 9:24-27 NLT</p>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig said, ‚ÄúDiscipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.‚Äù How does that statement play out in your own life?</li>

<ul>
  <li>What do you want most? Invite God‚Äôs guidance into your answer.</li>
