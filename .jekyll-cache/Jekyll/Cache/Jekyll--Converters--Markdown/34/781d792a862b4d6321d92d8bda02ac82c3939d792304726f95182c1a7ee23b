<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did you ever play Truth or Dare as a kid? What‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt believe you said or did?</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs the most courageous prayer you‚Äôve said and seen answered?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do you think it‚Äôs important to ask God to search you?</li>
  <li>Why do you think we tend to be afraid of God‚Äôs searchlight?</li>
  <li>Can you think of anything that‚Äôs hard to hear about yourself? How might you be living to avoid hearing that thing?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does the idea of asking God to search your heart make you feel? Is anything keeping you from praying this prayer? If so, what?</li>
  <li>Is there anything that seems to cause you constant or unnecessary anxiety? How will you begin to trust God with this fear?</li>
  <li>What makes you feel most defensive? What do you think the Holy Spirit would say to you about it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holy Spirit, please show us the junk our lives that offends You. Cause it to offend us like it does You. Let it smell like old trash to us. And Father, help us to trade this garbage for the full life You promised.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about reflection.</p>
