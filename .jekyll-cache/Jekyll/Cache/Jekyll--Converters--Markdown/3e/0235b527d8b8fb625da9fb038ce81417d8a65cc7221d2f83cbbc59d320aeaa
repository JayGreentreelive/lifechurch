<p>Three Responses to God‚Äôs Call</p>

  <li>A genuine understanding of God‚Äôs <strong>grace</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name a place you‚Äôd love to be sent to and a place you‚Äôd never want to be sent to. Why?</li>
  <li>Which has been an anchor message for you: <em>Search Me</em>, <em>Break Me</em>, or <em>Send Me</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do your prayers revolve more around what God can do for you or what you can do for God? Give an example of how you‚Äôd like to be praying.</li>
  <li>List some typical excuses people give for not going to the places‚Äîor doing the work‚ÄîGod calls them to.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which do you most lack: genuine experience with God, awareness of your sinfulness, or understanding of His grace?</li>
  <li>Talk about the last time you felt compelled to do something out of your norm. How did you respond? Could it have been God sending you?</li>
  <li>Currently, do you most identify with Jonah, Moses, or Isaiah? What might be keeping you from full surrender to God?</li>
  <li>Just like brokenness, being sent is not a one-time experience. To what or where are you being sent now?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lord, here we are. Make us aware of our brokenness. Show us Your grace, God. And, send us to the people and places where You need us. Amen.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about surrender.</p>
