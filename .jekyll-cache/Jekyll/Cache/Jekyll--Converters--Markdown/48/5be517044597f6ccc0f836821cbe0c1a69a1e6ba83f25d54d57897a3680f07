<p class="lead">Think back through Craigâ€™s message. What sticks out to you?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p>The Apostle Paulâ€™s Thorn<br />
2 Corinthians 12:1-10</p>

<p><em>Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. Each time he said, â€œMy grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.â€ So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.</em><br />
2 Corinthians 12:8-9 NLT</p>

<h3 id="three-things-to-remember">Three Things To Remember</h3>

<ol>
  <li>True prayer isnâ€™t about getting our way but surrendering our will.</li>
  <li>Prayer reminds us we are not in control and keeps us close to the one who is.</li>
  <li>Prayer isnâ€™t just asking but trusting.</li>
</ol>

<p>â€œGodâ€™s grace fills the gap between our pain and His promises.â€</p>

<p>Me: â€œThis is what I need.â€ God: â€œNo, Iâ€™m what you need.â€</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whatâ€™s something funny you regularly ask God to do? Find keys, no red lights â€¦?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the most outlandish prayer youâ€™ve said or heard?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of Godâ€™s answers to prayer as pure grace, not something you deserve. How could this change the way you view Godâ€™s cooperativeness?</li>
  <li>Read 2 Corinthians 12:7. Paul says the thorn was â€œgivenâ€ to him. Why? By whom? What do you think about this verse?</li>
  <li>Craig described prayer as surrendering our will, not getting our way. Which do your prayers sound like? How would you shift?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be honest. Whatâ€™s something you need or want, but it feels like
God just wonâ€™t cooperate.</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s one of the hardest things youâ€™re facing? Whatâ€™s the scariest part about not being about to select the action you want God to take?</li>
  <li>Think of your greatest difficulty. If God never removed it, how could this struggle help you become more reliant on Him?</li>
  <li>What would you have to do differently to realize Godâ€™s grace is simply enough.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>God, this is a sore subject. Sometimes we feel like Youâ€™re uncooperative to solve our pain. The truth is, we want Your will instead of our way. You, not what You can do, but You alone are what we need. Thank You for being enough. Amen.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about relying on grace.</p>
