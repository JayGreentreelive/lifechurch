<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2co.4.7-9,16-18.niv">2 Corinthians 4:7-9,16-18</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.1.2-4.niv">James 1:2-4</a></p>

<p>This week‚Äôs movie is based on the life of Louie Zamperini, an Olympic track star and WWII hero. Louie‚Äôs extraordinary determination‚Äîfounded in his faith in God‚Äîgives him the strength to stand against all odds.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you can take it, you can make it. But you don‚Äôt have to make it alone. You have the power of Christ.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you ever experienced a runner‚Äôs high? What‚Äôs it like?</li>
  <li>What are some daunting things you do that pay off?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 1 to 100 percent, how much of what Louie faced do you think you could handle? What do you think got him to 100?</li>
  <li>On a bad day, are you likely to: give up, get mad, go on, or get help?</li>
  <li>Which scene plays over in your head? How could you apply it to a situation in your life?</li>
  <li>Pretend for a moment your struggle is happening to someone else. What would you do or say to support them?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share a life-or-death story. How did it change you?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you aren‚Äôt starting because you‚Äôre worried you won‚Äôt finish? What will you miss out on if you never try?</li>
  <li>What are you experiencing that feels emotionally, spiritually, physically, or professionally impossible? Where or how will you find the strength to get through it?</li>
  <li>Do you feel further from or closer to God when life stinks? If God answered this question about you, what would He say?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, You faced pain we can‚Äôt imagine to accomplish good we‚Äôll never deserve. Thank You. God, keep our eyes on Your promises as we run our race with You. Holy Spirit, be our strength and our peace in our struggle. Amen.</li>
</ul>
