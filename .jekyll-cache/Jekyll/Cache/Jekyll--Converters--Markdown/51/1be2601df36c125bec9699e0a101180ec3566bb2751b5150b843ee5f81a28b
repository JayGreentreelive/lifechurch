<p class="lead">Think back through Craig‚Äôs talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>Key Scripture 
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rev.3.15-20.niv">Revelations 3:15-20</a></p>

<h3 id="lukewarm-christians">Lukewarm Christians:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Crave acceptance from <strong>people</strong> more than acceptance from <strong>God</strong>.</li>
  <li>Rarely share their <strong>faith</strong> in Christ.</li>
  <li>Rationalize <strong>sin</strong>.</li>
  <li>Think more about life on <strong>earth</strong> than eternity in <strong>heaven</strong>.</li>
  <li>Only turn to God when they need <strong>something</strong>.</li>
  <li>They <strong>give</strong> whenever it‚Äôs convenient.</li>
  <li>They are not much <strong>different</strong> from the rest of the world.</li>
</ol>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so easy to be a Christian where I live that it‚Äôs difficult to be a true one.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow you live reflects the reality of what you believe.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Okay let ‚Äòem rip, tell your juiciest diaper changing stories.</li>
  <li>Make your argument for which is better: hot or cold coffee?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of someone with ‚Äúhot‚Äù faith. What sets them apart in your mind?</li>
  <li>Do you live <em>for</em> the approval of people or <em>from</em> the approval of God? How can you center your life on God‚Äôs perspective?</li>
  <li>Lukewarm is a super comfy temperature, how comfortable is your faith? What would turn up the heat?</li>
  <li>Do you find yourself more interested in what God has or what God wants? What do you think God wants for your life?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share some areas of your life where you need Jesus to bring heat? Sin, generosity, boldness, trust, closeness, faith?</li>
  <li>How does your life look different when your faith is ‚Äúhot?‚Äù Identify some roadblocks to consistently living this way.</li>
  <li>Share a story of a time when you knew that you were on fire for God. What are some themes in this story?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, You gave everything for us. Will You embolden us to go overboard for You? Holy Spirit, You are invited to show us the lukewarm places in our lives and then heat them up!</li>
</ul>
