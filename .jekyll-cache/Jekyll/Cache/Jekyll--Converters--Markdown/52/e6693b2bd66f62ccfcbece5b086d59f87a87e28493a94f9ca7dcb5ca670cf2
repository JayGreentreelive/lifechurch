<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is your team the winner this week? If not, what’s your favorite team? Do you even care?</li>
  <li>Which was your favorite commercial? What life changes does it inspire you to make?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are some ways our LifeGroup could help “invisible” people to feel needed and known?</li>
  <li>Read Psalm 118:24. Are you living like these are the good ol’ days? If not, what keeps you from focusing on today?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you ever feel like Mindy Kaling from the Invisible commercial? Read Isaiah 53:3. How does this passage make you feel?</li>
  <li>What are some things you’ve said, “Never!” about? What could make you change your mind?</li>
  <li>If you’re married, are you having the time of your life? How can you “be what you want” as Craig said?</li>
  <li>Parents, how do your children see God in you? What are some ways you’re winning? What are some ways you can improve?</li>
  <li>How can we be available to people in abusive situations?</li>
  <li>Imagine you could only pay with love. How would your financial status change? Who’d you be in debt to?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Father, will You give us the strength to live out the ideas we’ve discussed about being stronger dads, couples, friends, and followers after You? Teach us to be a church where people can belong before they believe. Amen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig asked us to pick the message we identify with. Which commercial and message will you act on? How?</li>
  <li>Dads and parents who want to step it up, start this Bible Plan. <a href="http://go2.lc/12mistakesplan">go2.lc/12mistakesplan</a></li>
  <li>Couples, check out <em>From This Day Forward</em>. <a href="http://go2.lc/couples">go2.lc/couples</a></li>
</ul>
