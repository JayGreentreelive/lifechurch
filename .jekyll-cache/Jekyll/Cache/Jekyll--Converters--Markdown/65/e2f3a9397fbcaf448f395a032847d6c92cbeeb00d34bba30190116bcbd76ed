<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fess up. Who‚Äôs someone famous you know almost everything about, but don‚Äôt really know them?</li>
  <li>Do you know God like Craig knows Amy, or like Craig knows George Brett?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of someone you know whose life exclaims the existence of God. Describe why.</li>
  <li>On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is ‚Äúall talk,‚Äù and 10 is ‚Äúall walk,‚Äù how much do you live like God exists?</li>
  <li>If you had to put it into categories, what parts of your faith are cultural tradition and what parts come from closeness to God?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where does your faith land: don‚Äôt know Him, know Him but not well, or know Him intimately and serve Him wholeheartedly?</li>
  <li>Where do you want your faith to be? What are some life changes that could help you get there?</li>
  <li>Has the Holy Spirit ever prodded you, comforted you, or strengthened you? Share a story of closeness to God.</li>
  <li>What do you most often call God, and how often do you talk with Him? How does this define your relationship with Him?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Father, we need to know You better. Will you draw us to You? Holy Spirit, be our daily guide and strength. Jesus, move us from information to transformation. Thank You, Father!</li>
</ul>
