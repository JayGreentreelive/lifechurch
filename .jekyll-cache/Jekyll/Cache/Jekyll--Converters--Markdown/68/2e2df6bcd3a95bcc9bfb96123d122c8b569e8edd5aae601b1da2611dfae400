<p class="lead">Review the key points from Craigâ€™s talk, what stuck out?</p>

<p><strong>We are all guilty of breaking Godâ€™s laws.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.2.10.niv">James 2:10</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.7.9.niv">Luke 7:9</a>  <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.23.32-33,39-41.niv">Luke 23:32-33,39-41</a></p>

<p><em>â€œWe donâ€™t have eternal life because weâ€™re good. We have it because God is good.â€</em></p>

<p>We are all one of two thieves.</p>

<p><strong>Thief #1: Unrepentant</strong><br />
(Prideful, critical, entitled, no fear of God, no need for a savior)</p>

<p><strong>Thief #2: Repentant</strong><br />
(Feared God, broken, humbled, desperate, needed forgiveness)</p>

<p><em>â€œThe second thief deserved death, but Jesus gave him life!â€</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.23.42-43.niv">Luke 23:42-43</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.103.10.niv">Psalm 103:10</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.1.3.niv">1 Peter 1:3</a></p>

<p><em>â€œJesus gave up what He deserved to give us what we donâ€™t deserve.â€</em></p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Where will you lead your group? Pick and choose from these suggestions to create the right discussion for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell your best â€œgetting caughtâ€ story that wasnâ€™t so funny when it happened.</li>
  <li>Best Easter traditionâ€”letâ€™s hear it.</li>
  <li>Not everyone has an I-stole-these-running-shorts-for-my-mom story, yet the Bible says we all come up short. Talk about the moment you first realized you needed Jesusâ€™ forgiveness.</li>
  <li>How do you approach your sin and shortcomings differently now that youâ€™ve realized your need for a savior?</li>
  <li>Craig talked about how the second thief had to be saved by grace through faith, not works. Do you live like youâ€™re saved by your belief in Jesus or by your accomplishments for Jesus?</li>
  <li>What is one thing youâ€™re facing that desperately needs the saving power of what Jesus has already done?</li>
  <li>Is there any guilt you need to acknowledge so Jesus can give you life?</li>
  <li>Read Romans 6:23 as a group. Does it compute for you that death is what you deserve? How should this realization change the way you live?</li>
  <li>Pray together to thank Jesus for the specific ways He already gave and continues to give you what you donâ€™t deserve.</li>
</ul>
