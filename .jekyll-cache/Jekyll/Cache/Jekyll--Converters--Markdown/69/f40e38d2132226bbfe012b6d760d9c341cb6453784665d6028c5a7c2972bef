<p>Key Scripture</p>

<p><em>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh‚Äôs daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.</em> <br />
Hebrews 11:24-26 NIV</p>

<p><em>Peter and the other apostles replied: ‚ÄúWe must obey God rather than human beings!‚Äù</em> <br />
Acts 5:29 NIV</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you ever been called a people-pleaser? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Jock, nerd, rocker, gangsta, gamer, cheerleader‚Äîwhich high school stereotype had you pegged?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig said, ‚ÄúLiving for the approval of people keeps you from the purposes of God.‚Äù Why do you think that is?</li>
  <li>Read Hebrews 11:24-26. Compare and contrast Moses‚Äô story with cultural norms and modern success stories.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read Nehemiah 6:1-3. To what distraction do you need to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing a great work; I can‚Äôt come down.‚Äù What great work are you doing?</li>
  <li>What parts of your life are painful right now? What purpose is the pain affecting? How can that purpose push you through it?</li>
  <li>In what ways have you valued pleasing others over pleasing God? What one thing could you do to shift the greater value to God?</li>
  <li>Was there any point in the message or our conversation where you felt God speaking to you? What was it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p>

<p><em>God, there is power in purpose‚Äîespecially Your purpose. We‚Äôre asking You to refocus our attentions to the passions and plans You‚Äôve placed in our lives. Help us to make pleasing You the main thing. Amen.</em></p>
