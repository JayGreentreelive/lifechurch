<p class="lead">Think back through Craigâ€™s message. What sticks out to you?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p>The Story of Lazarus<br />
John 11:1-44</p>

<p><em>â€œLord,â€ Martha said to Jesus, â€œif you had been here, my brother would not have diedâ€¦.â€</em>
John 11:22 NIV</p>

<h3 id="two-things-to-remember-when-waiting-on-god">Two Things To Remember When Waiting On God:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Godâ€™s delays are not necessarily Godâ€™s denials.</li>
  <li>If God always met your expectations, Heâ€™d never have the opportunity to exceed them.</li>
</ol>

<p>â€œWith God, a waiting season is never a wasted season.â€</p>

<p>â€œThe scene of your greatest disappointment may be the setting of your greatest miracle.â€</p>

<p>â€œMary and Martha wanted a healingâ€”Jesus wanted a resurrection.â€</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is your worst story of showing up somewhere late?</li>
  <li>Is your patience like Craigâ€™s? What is the hardest thing for you to wait on?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whatâ€™s something youâ€™re currently waiting for God to do for you? What might He be doing in you?</li>
  <li>Why do you think Godâ€™s timing is different from ours? What could be so different about our perspective?</li>
  <li>Do you think youâ€™d be more like Mary who stayed home when Jesus was late or Martha who told Him He was late? Why?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you experienced a situation when God was late that still doesnâ€™t make sense? Whatâ€™s it like to go through that?</li>
  <li>Pastor Craig said, â€œGodâ€™s delays are not Godâ€™s denials.â€ Does this change your perspective of Godâ€™s timing?</li>
  <li>Share a story of a time God exceeded your expectations. How can you hold on to this as a promise of His faithfulness?</li>
  <li>What can you do to allow room for God to make miracles out of your disappointments?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, forgive us for the times we reject You and doubt You because of Your timing. Will You also give us strength to trust You when Youâ€™re not on our schedule, or when our outcomes really hurt? Thank You for Your grace to work in us. Amen.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about trusting God.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/isa.40.31.niv">Isaiah 40:31</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.27.13-14.niv">Psalm 27:13-14</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.5.7-8.niv">James 5:7-8</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.18.1-8.niv">Luke 18:1-8</a></p>
