<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you were poured out into a cup, what kind of drink would you be?</li>
  <li>Thumb, blanky, mom? How did you find refuge as a kid?</li>
  <li>Share some ways you’ve seen God’s faithfulness in the past.</li>
  <li>Where is your safe place? How often do you go there?</li>
  <li>What does holiness mean to you? How often do you reflect on who God is?</li>
  <li>Who do you pour out your heart to? Why do you trust them?</li>
  <li>What are some things that you need to pour out to God? Why have you been holding on to those things so closely?</li>
  <li>Talk about the last time it was just really hard to worship. How did you break through?</li>
  <li>When did you last unload to God? What happened next?</li>
  <li>How do you keep track of what God has done for you?</li>
  <li>Does your worship come from the depths of your soul? If yes, how does that look, if no, what are some barriers?</li>
  <li>Which parts of your future do you need to entrust to God’s power?</li>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss as a group how you’ll remember God’s faithfulness. Is it journaling or phone reminders? Is there an app for that?</li>
  <li>Make a list of situations that require God’s power. Bring your list to God in worship this week.</li>
  <li>What is heavy on your heart that our group could pray with you about? How can we worship through these issues together?</li>
</ul>
