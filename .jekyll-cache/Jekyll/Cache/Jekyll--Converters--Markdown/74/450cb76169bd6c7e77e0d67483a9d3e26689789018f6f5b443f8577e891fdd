<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to [Jesus] and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”</em><br />
Luke 10:38-40 NIV</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you got two extra hours each day, what would you do more of?</li>
  <li>Which word best describes your last few weeks? Relaxed, busy, full, fun, rewarding. Why?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read Luke 10:38-40. Do you identify with Mary or Martha? Explain.</li>
  <li>Why do you think we’re tempted to allow urgent things to rule our lives?</li>
  <li>Craig said busyness does not equal productivity. What busyness can you cut out of your life?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name three urgent things you need to do and three important things you need to do. Which are getting more of your time?</li>
  <li>Do you have a process or trick that reminds you to choose important over urgent? Share an example.</li>
  <li>What’s the most important thing you’ve been too distracted to pursue? What do you need to stop doing to pursue it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p>

<p><em>Jesus, You lived a short life here on earth yet accomplished the most important work of all. Thank You. Will You give us the strength to think long-term and people-first? Will You help us to refocus on what matters most? Amen.</em></p>

  <li>Start the <em>I Choose</em> Bible Plan and hear from people who discovered how to choose <em>Important Over Urgent</em>. <a href="http://go2.lc/ichoose">www.go2.lc/ichoose</a></li>
