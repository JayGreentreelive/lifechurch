<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kids say and do the funniest things. Who‚Äôs got a story?</li>
  <li>Do you celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day weekend? How?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How would your life look different if you believed you were God‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlan A‚Äù to care for people without families?</li>
  <li>Read James 1:27. Why do you think widows and orphans are highlighted specifically?</li>

</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who do you know who‚Äôs involved in foster care or adoption? How can you support them?</li>
  <li>Have you or someone you‚Äôre close to experienced fostering or adoption in some way? How have you been impacted?</li>
  <li>How do you feel called to respond? What bold step will you pray about making?</li>
</ul>
