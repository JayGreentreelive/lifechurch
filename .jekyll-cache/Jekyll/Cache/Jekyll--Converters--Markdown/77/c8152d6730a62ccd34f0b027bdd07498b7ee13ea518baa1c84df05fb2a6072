<p class="lead">Start your discussion by reviewing Pastor Craigâ€™s key points.</p>

<p>This weekâ€™s text is Daniel 10:5-19.</p>

<p><em>â€œSometimes God has something just for you that others wouldnâ€™t understand.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œThe strongest of men cannot bear the weight of the glory of God.â€</em></p>

<p>Three things to remember when standing in faith:</p>

<ol>
  <li>God <strong>cares</strong> about <strong>you</strong> more than you do. <em>â€œYou are very precious to God. Not only does God love you, He likes you.â€</em></li>
  <li>God is <strong>doing</strong> more than you understand. <em>â€œSince the first time you prayed, God heard the cry of your heart!â€</em></li>
  <li>Godâ€™s <strong>strength</strong> is made perfect in your weakness. <em>â€œUntil you understand your weakness, you wonâ€™t appreciate Godâ€™s strength.â€</em></li>
</ol>
