<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who‚Äôs your favorite reality TV judge? What would it be like for you to be judged by them?</li>
  <li>What is one of the first times you remember being judged? How did it make you feel?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe a time when you judged someone superficially. Why do you think it‚Äôs so easy to do?</li>
  <li>Why are superficial judgments harmful to relationships?</li>
  <li>How would you define a hypocrite? How do you think people become hypocritical?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the situations in your life where you feel most judged? When are you most judgmental of others?</li>
  <li>Which of Pastor Craig‚Äôs four points are most difficult for you to live out? Why?</li>
  <li>Do you ever have standards for others that you struggle to meet yourself? If so, what‚Äôs another alternative?</li>
  <li>Do you lean more toward grace or truth? How is God using this teaching to help you grow?</li>
  <li>Read Galatians 6:1-2. Discuss the type of relationship that would be necessary for this kind of restoration.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, if anyone has the right to judge, it‚Äôs You. Yet You came to save the world, not to condemn it. As we become more like You, will You teach us to restore the people around us, not to destroy them? Thank You for Your grace to save us. Amen.</li>
