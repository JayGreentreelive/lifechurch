<h3 id="8-reasons-im-optimistic-from-romans-8">8 Reasons I‚Äôm Optimistic From Romans 8</h3>

<ol>
  <li>My sins are forgiven, and my eternity is secure.</li>
  <li>Jesus is at the right hand of God praying for me.</li>
  <li>My future victory is greater than my present pain.</li>
  <li>My mind is filled with the peace of God.</li>
  <li>If God is for me, who can be against me?</li>
  <li>God‚Äôs Spirit helps me in my weakness.</li>
  <li>God‚Äôs working everything in my life for good.</li>
  <li>Nothing can separate me from the love of God.</li>
</ol>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm optimistic not because of what I feel, not because of what I see, but because of what God says.‚Äù</p>
