<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a genie in a bottle granted you one wish, what would you ask for (no wishing for more wishes)?</li>
  <li>What does worship mean to you? How did this message help shape that definition?</li>
  <li>Have you ever worshiped with raised hands? How did that posture change your perspective of God?</li>
  <li>On a scale of carrying a big-screen to shot blocking, how do you raise your hands?</li>
  <li>Why do we do something with our hands to reflect something in our heart? What are some examples of that in our culture?</li>
  <li>What are some ways youâ€™ve seen Godâ€™s love is better than life?</li>
  <li>How have you noticed your mood or circumstances affecting how you participate in worship?</li>
  <li>When you worship God, what percentage is at church? How could you surrender to God in worship every day of the week?</li>
  <li>What are some battles youâ€™re facing? How could you attack these problems with praise?</li>
  <li>What gets in the way of you being the kind of worshiper God deserves?</li>
  <li>Who is someone who has been there to hold up your arms? Talk about what that meant to you.</li>
</ul>
