<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share any re-gifting accidents you‚Äôve been a part of. How else have you seen being a tightwad come back to bite you?</li>
  <li>‚ÄúNever enough‚Äù or ‚Äúalways more,‚Äù how does your perspective affect your joy?</li>
  <li>Share a time when you felt blessed from giving to others. How does it compare to other things that bring you joy?</li>
  <li>Are you giving more than you receive at home, work, your community, and at church?</li>
  <li>How have you seen generosity modeled for you by others or in your childhood? What stories do you remember?</li>
  <li>Tell a story of a time that you gave more than you thought you could. What was the result?</li>
  <li>Think of someone who‚Äôs irrationally generous. Describe what has caused them to earn that reputation.</li>
  <li>What keeps you from giving more? What are you trying to protect when you choose against greater generosity?</li>
  <li>What are some resources that you‚Äôre holding on to that you could be giving away?</li>
  <li>How can you make generosity something that you plan for and stand firm for?</li>
