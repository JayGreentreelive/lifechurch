<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.</em><br />
1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.4.15.niv">Hebrews 4:15</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.10.12.niv">1 Corinthians 10:12</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.1.13-15.niv">James 1:13-15</a></p>

<h3 id="four-truths-about-temptation">Four Truths About Temptation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>It‚Äôs not a <strong>sin</strong> to be <strong>tempted</strong>.</li>
  <li>You are never <strong>above</strong> temptation.</li>
  <li>God will <strong>never</strong> tempt you.</li>
  <li>There is <strong>always</strong> a way <strong>out</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>‚ÄúTemptation is anything that promises satisfaction at the cost of obedience to God.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEvery temptation is an invitation to depend on Christ.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What food tempts you most? Donuts, cheeseburgers, baked kale, something else?</li>
  <li>Tell a funny story about getting caught. Cookie jar, anyone?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think about your last temptation. Was there a way out? How can you get better at taking the way out?</li>
  <li>Think of something you do that‚Äôs not outright beneficial. Talk about what it may be costing you.</li>
  <li>Read Hebrews 4:15. Do you think of Jesus this way? How does knowing He‚Äôs been tempted in every way help you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How often does what Craig described as ‚Äúfalse guilt‚Äù trick you into giving up?</li>
  <li>Are there any areas of your life where you‚Äôre living like you‚Äôre above temptation? Identify common blind spots as a group.</li>
  <li>Do you see God as growing you when you struggle or causing you to struggle? How does this perspective affect you?</li>
  <li>Open up. What are some ways this group can help each other find a way out?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, we may fall into temptation, but You died and rose so we could be free! We invite You to show us where we need a way out, and please strengthen us to go through it. Thank You, God, for this group of people to go through life with. Amen.</li>
</ul>
