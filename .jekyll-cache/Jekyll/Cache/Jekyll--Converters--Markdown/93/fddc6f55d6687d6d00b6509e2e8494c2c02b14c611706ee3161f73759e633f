<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let‚Äôs brag for a minute. How much can you handle? Share a typical multi-tasking scenario you handle on a regular basis?</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs the most terrible spiritual advice you‚Äôve ever gotten?</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs consuming most of your energy right now?</li>
  <li>When you‚Äôre overwhelmed, you‚Äôre most likely to: double your efforts, eat something tasty, ask for help, go somewhere peaceful, or do something fun?</li>
  <li>What habits can you create in order to make God‚Äôs presence the first place you go when you‚Äôre overwhelmed?</li>
  <li>What specific weakness do you need to embrace to fully experience the power of God?</li>
  <li>How does it make you feel to think about laying something down that you care a lot about?</li>
  <li>How have you experienced the presence of God when you had more than you could handle?</li>
  <li>What do you think God is asking you to let Him carry?</li>
</ul>
