<p class="lead">Start by reviewing this week’s passage and key points.</p>

<p><em>Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</em><br /> <strong>- Matthew 22:34-39 NIV</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>He relentlessly pursues us even when we don’t pursue Him.</li>
  <li>He doesn’t give us what we deserve.</li>
  <li>He meets us all the way.</li>
</ol>

<p>“Whatever you believe about you is mostly based on what you told you about yourself.”</p>
