<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: 10 If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.</em> <br />
Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</p>

<p><em>Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.</em> <br />
Nehemiah 4:14</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who knows how many Rocky movies there are? Which is your favorite?</li>
  <li>Do you have any friends who are like family? How did they become that way?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. Can you think of any part of your life where you absolutely don’t rely on anyone else? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Think for a minute about the most important turning points in your life. Did other people support you? How?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What fight are you up against right now? Who is fighting along side you?</li>
  <li>Think about the people in your life for a second. Who’s fighting a battle and needs you at their side?</li>
  <li>Pick where you’re at and talk and pray as a group?
    <ul>
      <li>I’m grateful for my friendships and I feel like I’m relationally full and blessed right now.</li>
      <li>I have some good friends, but I feel like don’t always have someone to go to.</li>
      <li>I’m really hurting right now when it comes to relying on other people.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p><em>Holy Spirit, You came to be our comforter and friend. Jesus, you are closer than a brother. God, you are the ultimate Father. Will You help us to make relationship one of the most important things we do? Amen.</em></p>
