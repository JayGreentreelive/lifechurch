I"š<p class="lead">Think back to Craig's message. What sticks out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, â€œWhy do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?â€ Jesus answered them, â€œIt is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.â€</em><br />
Luke 5:29-32 NIV</p>

<p><em>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, â€œCome, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?â€ They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</em><br />
John 4:28-30 NIV</p>

<p><em>He replied, â€œWhether [Jesus] is a sinner or not, I donâ€™t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!â€ Then they asked him, â€œWhat did [Jesus] do to you? How did he open your eyes?â€ He answered, â€œI have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?</em><br />
John 9:25-27 NIV</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you in sharing your faith?</li>
  <li>Do you have any uncomfortable door-to-door type experiences like Craigâ€™s? Letâ€™s hear it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you have that you could use to share your life and faith with others?</li>
  <li>Read Luke 5:29-32. What do you think about Jesusâ€™ analogy of the healthy and the sick? How does this apply to you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig gave four reasons we donâ€™t share our faith. What are yours? What would make the difference for you?</li>
  <li>What is your story? Do you ever share it with others? What does that look like for you?</li>
  <li>Have you ever led someone to find Christ? Can you share that experience?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p>

<p>Jesus, what You did for us is something weâ€™ve just got to tell people about. Will You open our eyes to the opportunities we have to reach out to people around us? We pray You would interrupt us with people who need Your love. Amen.</p>

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig talked about using what you have, inviting someone to church, and sharing your story. Which will you start with this week? How?</li>
  <li>Start the <em>Share Jesus</em> Bible Plan for ideas and motivation to share your faith. <a href="https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/1600-share-jesus-go-give-life">www.go2.lc/sharejesus</a></li>
