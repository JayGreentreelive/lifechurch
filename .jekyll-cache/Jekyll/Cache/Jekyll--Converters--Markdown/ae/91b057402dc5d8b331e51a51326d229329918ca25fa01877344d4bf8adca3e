<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much time per day are you alone? No people, phone, music, TV, book, or anything. Just you.</li>
  <li>Think about Craig‚Äôs message for 30 seconds. What one thing do you remember? Is it causing you to do anything different?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will the concept of relational poverty make you think or act differently?</li>
  <li>Can you think of someone who‚Äôs lonely? What are some practical ways you can you act like Jesus and love them?</li>
  <li>What do you think are the greatest contributing factors to loneliness in yourself and people you know?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How have you replaced true relationship with forms of ‚Äúdeferred loneliness‚Äù?¬†Give some examples.</li>
  <li>Share about a time someone simply listened to you and it was exactly what you needed. How can you listen more?</li>
  <li>Do you ever feel lonely? How will you invite people into your life?</li>
  <li>Time, listening, and touch. Which of these three can you get better at giving? To whom?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about caring for children.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.1.5.niv">Joshua 1:5</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.13.1-3.niv">Hebrews 13:1-3</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.20.5.niv">Proverbs 20:5</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psalm.71.9.niv">Psalm 71:9</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p><em>Holy Spirit, please empower us to overcome our relational poverty. Help us ditch deferred loneliness and engage in real relationship with people in front of us. Also, will You show us specific people You‚Äôd like to comfort through us? Amen.</em></p>
