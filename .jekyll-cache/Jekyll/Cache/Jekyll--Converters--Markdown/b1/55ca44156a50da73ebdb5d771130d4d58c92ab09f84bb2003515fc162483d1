<p class="lead">Review the key points from Craigâ€™s talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>The Woman Caught in Adultery <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.1-12.niv">John 8:1-12</a></p>

<p><em>â€œ<strong>Go now</strong> and <strong>leave your life of sin</strong>.â€</em> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.11.niv">John 8:11b</a></p>

<p><em>So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus</em>. <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/rom.8.1.nlt">Romans 8:1 NLT</a></p>

<p><em>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, â€œI am the <strong>light of the world</strong>. Whoever follows me will <strong>never walk in darkness</strong>, but will have the light of life.â€</em> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.12.niv">John 8:12</a></p>

<p>â€œWhen the light of the world becomes the light of your world, you will never walk in darkness.â€</p>

<p class="lead">Where will you lead your group? Pick and choose from these suggestions to create the right discussion for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember Craigâ€™s baby monitor story? Whatâ€™s your version of a #worststoryever?</li>
  <li>Are comparisons or past failures bringing you shame? How do you form your view of yourself?</li>
  <li>Describe what you thought and felt in a moment that your shameâ€”or the reason for itâ€”was taken away.</li>
  <li>â€œYouâ€™re used goods.â€ â€œThis is just the way you are.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a fake.â€ What voices of condemnation do you hear?</li>
  <li>You donâ€™t have to get caught to feel condemned. Describe a time when you brought your issue to the light and got freedom.</li>
  <li>What do you need to leave behind so you can â€œgo and leave your life of sinâ€?</li>
  <li>When you catch people in their brokenness, do you look more like Jesus or the religious leaders?</li>
  <li>Why do you think we attach shame to certain sins more than others? How do you think this works against us?</li>
  <li>Read Romans 8:1 as a group. Do you live like this is true? How would truly believing this transform your daily life?</li>
</ul>

  <li>Ask the Holy Spirit to point out dark areas in your life where you need to trade condemnation for Jesusâ€™ mercy and light. Pray together as a group and invite Jesus to free you.</li>
