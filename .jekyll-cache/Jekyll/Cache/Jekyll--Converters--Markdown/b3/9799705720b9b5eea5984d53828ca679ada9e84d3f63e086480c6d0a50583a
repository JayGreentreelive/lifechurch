<p>The Widow of Zarephath</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1ki.17.8-16.niv">1 Kings 17:8-16</a></p>

<p><em>“The most barren place can bear the seeds of the most unlikely result.”</em></p>

<p><em>“If you don’t embrace your place here you’ll never do it there.”</em></p>

<p>God has given you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Talent</li>
  <li>Tongue</li>
  <li>Treasure</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“Wherever you are now is where God wants you to sow your time, talent, tongue, and treasure.”</em></p>

<p><em>“She was so busy looking at what she didn’t have, she forgot to see what she did have — the ingredients of a miracle.”</em></p>

<p><em>“God’s looking for availability not ability.”</em></p>

<p><em>“God still goes to unlikely places, still uses unlikely people, still implements unlikely strategies, and still produces unlikely outcomes.”</em></p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">How can you best facilitate discussion that will be engaging for everyone? Choose from these suggestions to lead each person in your group to own their own growth.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vote for who can do the best Christine Caine impersonation. Who can say as many words per minute as she can?</li>
  <li>Are you the kind of person who focuses on what you don’t have or what you do have? Share an example.</li>
  <li>Share something you’ve seen God do around you recently that was highly unlikely.</li>
  <li>What miracle are you living in the middle of that you don’t often recognize?</li>
  <li>What are some things you do have that you believe God could use in His house to do His work?</li>
  <li>Share a time when you allowed a scarcity mentality to dictate how you acted. Then share a time when you acted from an abundance mindset.</li>
  <li>How have you or your family and friends been blessed by other people who have planted their time, talent, tongue, or treasure in our church?</li>
  <li>Of the four T-words, which one are you most generous with? Which one do you need to plant more of?</li>
  <li>What obstacles (or maybe just excuses) are keeping you from planting what you have here in His house?</li>
</ul>
