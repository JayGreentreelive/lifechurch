<p>Three Reasons People Stop Short</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our <strong>perspective</strong> gets blocked.<br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.6.1-5.niv">Joshua 6:1-5</a><br />
<em>â€œOnly God can speak in past tense about the battles you havenâ€™t even fought yet.â€</em></li>
  <li>Our <strong>progress</strong> isnâ€™t always obvious.<br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.6.6-14.niv">Joshua 6:6-14</a><br />
<em>â€œGod doesnâ€™t want you to trust in your progress, He wants you to have faith in His promise.â€</em></li>
  <li>The <strong>process</strong> is open-ended.<br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.6.15-16,20.niv">Joshua 6:15-16,20</a><br />
<em>â€œDo you trust that God is working even when what youâ€™re doing doesnâ€™t seem to be working?â€</em></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">How far do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to tailor the discussion to suit your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you ever written a sappy poem like Steven did for Craig? Care to recite a line?</li>
  <li>Do you have a dream or goal you stopped short of reaching? Share the first one you think of.</li>
  <li>What is a wall thatâ€™s blocking your perspective and stopping you short?</li>
  <li>What is a part of your life where Godâ€™s promise doesnâ€™t match what you see?</li>
  <li>How can we incorporate perspective-altering worship into our week?</li>
  <li>Can you identify with Joshuaâ€™s armed men? What are some healthy behaviors you repeat daily without noticing progress?</li>
  <li>Take some time to point out and encourage each otherâ€™s persistence.</li>
  <li>What are you facing that requires you to just â€œshut up and marchâ€ without seeing the outcome or knowing the distance?</li>
  <li>Have you ever trusted your progress more than Godâ€™s promise? Why do you think that happens?</li>
  <li>Say a prayer together asking God to use the wall in front of you to do His work inside of you.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Choose a closing question to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What concept keeps playing over in your mind? Say it out loud and ask the group to identify a simple action plan with you.</li>
  <li>Remind each other throughout the week to spend less time talking about the size of lifeâ€™s walls and more time talking about, reading about, and walking in Godâ€™s promises.</li>
  <li>Read this seven-day Bible reading plan about overcoming walls: <a href="https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/992-walls-fall-down-gods-unusual-plan-for-victory">go2.lc/walls</a></li>
