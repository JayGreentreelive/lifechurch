<p>Key Scripture</p>

<p><em>Remember this‚Äîa farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop. You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don‚Äôt give reluctantly or in response to pressure. ‚ÄúFor God loves a person who gives cheerfully.‚Äù And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others. As the Scriptures say, ‚ÄúThey share freely and give generously to the poor. Their good deeds will be remembered forever.‚Äù For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you. Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God. So two good things will result from this ministry of giving‚Äîthe needs of the believers in Jerusalem will be met, and they will joyfully express their thanks to God.</em> 
2 Corinthians 9:6-12 NLT</p>
