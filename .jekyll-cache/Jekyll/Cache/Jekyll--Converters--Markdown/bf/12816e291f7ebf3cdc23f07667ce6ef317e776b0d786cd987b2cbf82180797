I"È<h2 id="the-movie">The Movie</h2>
<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.15.12-13.niv">John 15:12-13</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.12.9-10.niv">Romans 12:9-10</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1jo.4.7-12.niv">1 John 4:7-12</a></p>

<p>The movie is based on the true story about a group of Sudanese children who survived the ravages of war and stood together against all odds. Itâ€™s a story of friends laying their lives down for their friends.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are your three favorite movies of all time?</li>
  <li>Name some movies that had a significant impact on your life.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you think youâ€™d have the guts to give yourself over to armed men to save your siblings?</li>
  <li>Who do you know that lives with the courage, compassion, and humility of the main characters? Describe them.</li>
  <li>Which scene stands out in your mind? How is it changing you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be honest. When you help others, do you look more like the earlier, inconvenienced version of Carrie or the later, fully engaged version?</li>
  <li>Not everyone can help a Sudanese immigrant, but what can you do to meet the needs of people in your community?</li>
  <li>Did this film inspire you to restore a relationship with a loved one? Talk with your group about the best ways to do that.</li>
  <li>How are you doing at honoring others above yourself? Why do you think it can be so hard? What would make it easier?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, You gave us the first and best example when You laid down Your life for us. Will You teach us how to live like You? Help us become less so that You become greater. Lead us into healthy relationships, and help us restore broken ones.</li>
</ul>
