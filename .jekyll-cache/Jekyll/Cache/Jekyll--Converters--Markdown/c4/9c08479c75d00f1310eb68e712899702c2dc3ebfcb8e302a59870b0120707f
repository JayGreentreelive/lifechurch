<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œJesus Take the Wheel!â€ If your faith is a song title, which is it?</li>
  <li>Traffic lights, parking spaces, thigh dimples â€” what is the smallest thing youâ€™ve prayed for?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the biggest thing youâ€™ve ever prayed for?</li>
  <li>On Craigâ€™s 1-10 scale, how did you rate your faith? Share what caused you to rate your faith that way.</li>
  <li>Have you ever had a moment of faith like the centurion in Capernaum? What inspired you to believe?</li>
  <li>What specific fears or doubts hold you back from complete faith in God? What could help you strengthen that trust?</li>
  <li>What are some things youâ€™ve learned in the past when you stepped out in faith?</li>
  <li>In what areas are you relying on a guarantee instead of Godâ€™s amazing grace?</li>
  <li>What securities could be keeping you from your destiny? How radical are you willing to get to let go of them?</li>
  <li>What is something that you know is good that scares the daylights of you?</li>
</ul>
