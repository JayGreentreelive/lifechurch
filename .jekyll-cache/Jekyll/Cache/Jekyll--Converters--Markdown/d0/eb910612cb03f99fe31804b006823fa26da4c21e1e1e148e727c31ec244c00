<h3 id="where-did-davids-enthusiasm-come-from">Where Did David’s Enthusiasm Come From?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>He <strong>trusted</strong> God daily.</li>
  <li>He <strong>walked</strong> with God daily.</li>
  <li>He <strong>worshipped</strong> God daily.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="two-seasons-of-davids-life">Two Seasons of David’s Life</h3>
<ol>
  <li>With enthusiasm, David <strong>ran</strong> into the battle to serve his <strong>God</strong>.</li>
  <li>With apathy, David <strong>walked</strong> on the roof to serve his <strong>comfort</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>“Enthusiasm isn’t just a mood. It’s a spiritual result of an intimate relationship with God.”</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you remember most from Craig’s talk?</li>
  <li>Do you know someone with enthusiasm like the singing woman in the airport? How do they make you feel?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did you think of enthusiasm as a godly trait before this message? Did any part of the message shift your thinking?</li>
  <li>What is something you’re currently feeling enthusiastic about?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share a time when you identified with enthusiastic David who ran into battle.</li>
  <li>Share a time when you identified with apathetic David who sought comfort.</li>
  <li>Looking back, what are the differences between the times you did and didn’t live with enthusiastic faith?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>God, we invite You to enter our attitudes. Help us not to be changed by the attitudes around us but to change the attitudes around us. We don’t just want to be excited; we want to live enthusiastically for You. Amen.</li>
</ul>
