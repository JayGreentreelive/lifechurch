<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>This is what the LORD Almighty says: â€œGive careful thought to your ways. Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,â€ says the LORD.</em><br />
Haggai 1:7-8 NIV</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/hag.1.1-8.niv">Haggai 1:1-8</a></p>

<h3 id="choose-the-hard-right-over-the-easy-wrong">Choose The Hard Right Over The Easy Wrong</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Itâ€™s easy to keep a sin secret. Itâ€™s hard and right to confess and ask for help.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s easy to keep buying what you want. Itâ€™s hard and right to deny yourself.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s easy to hold a grudge. Itâ€™s hard and right to forgive.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s easy to follow a crowd. Itâ€™s hard and right to not conform.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s easy to quit. Itâ€™s hard and right to press through with His strength.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-rebuild">How To Rebuild</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the mountain.</li>
  <li>Bring down the timber.</li>
  <li>Build His house.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>â€œThe way to get started is to quit talking and start doing.â€</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whoâ€™s helped build or rebuild something? Whatâ€™s the hardest part?</li>
  <li>What part of the message is still moving you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read Haggai 1:6. What is consistent throughout this verse?</li>
  <li>Why do you think the Jews had stalled in their progress of rebuilding Godâ€™s house?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s your greatest barrier to acting on Godâ€™s plans?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Has your life ever looked like Haggai 1:6? What have you learned from that period?</li>
  <li>Which area of your life do you most need to rebuild your devotion to God?</li>
  <li>Describe what your three steps to laying a new foundationâ€” based on Haggai 1:8â€”might look like.</li>
  <li>Have you ever had to lay a new foundation in your life before? What worked? How did it turn out?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holy Spirit, weâ€™re going to need Your help to see where our lives need remodeling. God, we need Your strength to stay dedicated to the work Youâ€™re doing in and through us. Will You come today and refresh our passion to make You known?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="from-the-source">From the Source</h2>
<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about feeding your spirit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.3.16.niv">1 Corinthians 3:16</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.1.22-25.niv">James 1:22-25</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.2.19-22.niv">Ephesians 2:19-22</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ecc.9.10.niv">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want help getting started? Our whole church is reading <em>The Time Is Now</em> Bible Plan at <a href="http://go2.lc/timeisnow">go2.lc/timeisnow</a></li>
  <li>What are some practical ways youâ€™ll make Godâ€™s work your priority? Write a list, and put it on your fridge.</li>
  <li>Do something for someone else or for the church instead of yourself this week. Then, make it a new habit.</li>
</ul>
