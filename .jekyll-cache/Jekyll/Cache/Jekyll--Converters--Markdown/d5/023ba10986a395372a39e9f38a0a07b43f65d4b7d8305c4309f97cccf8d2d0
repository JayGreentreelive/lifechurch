I"î<p class="lead">Think back to Joyce Meyerâ€™s message. What sticks out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?â€Â And He said to him, â€˜You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.â€™ This is the great andÂ foremost commandment.Â The second is like it, â€˜You shall love your neighbor as yourself.â€™Â On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.</em></p>

<p><strong>Matthew 22:36-40 NASB</strong></p>

<p><em>No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and HisÂ love is perfected in us.</em></p>

<p><strong>1 John 4:12 NASB</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-thoughts">Key Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>â€œYou canâ€™t be selfish and happy.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œYou canâ€™t give away what you donâ€™t have.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œAnything that remains stagnant dies. What He pours in, we must pour out.â€</em></p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many song titles can you think of about love? Ready, go!</li>
  <li>If you could only preach one message, what would you want to tell people about God?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the difference between loving yourself and being in love with yourself?</li>
  <li>How can loving yourself help you love others?</li>
  <li>Share a time when someoneâ€™s Christ-like love helped you see God in a new way.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whatâ€™s something you really like about yourself? Is that hard or easy for you to share? Why do you think that is?</li>
  <li>How could you step up your love factor with people who are difficult for you to love?</li>
  <li>What are some examples in your life when selfishness has kept you from being happy?</li>
  <li>Who is someone you need to spend time paying attention to this week? What will you do to listen to and encourage them?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about motives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34-35.niv">John 13:34-35</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1joh.4.7-8.niv">1 John 4:7-8</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.3.19.niv">Ephesians 3:19</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1cor.12.31.niv">1 Corinthians 12:31</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1joh.3.17-18.niv">1 John 3:17-18</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1cor.13.1-13.niv">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p><em>Jesus, we thank you so much for the love Youâ€™ve shown us. Help us to love the way You love. Help us individually and as a group to love in a way that shows You to the world. Amen.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œWe can simplify our life by thinking more about love.â€ What are some ways we can keep love at the top of our mind as we go through our week?</li>
  <li>What could our group do this summer to start a love revolution in our community? What can we do together that we wouldnâ€™t be able to do on our own?</li>
</ul>
