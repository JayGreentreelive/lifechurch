I"ñ<p class="lead">Think back to Craig's message. What sticks out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</em></p>

<p>Hebrews 2:1</p>

<h2 id="how-to-drift-from-god">How To Drift From God</h2>

<h3 id="1-neglect-your-time-with-god">1. Neglect your time with God.</h3>
<p>You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water. 
Psalm 63:1</p>

<h3 id="2-hang-around-the-wrong-people">2. Hang around the wrong people.</h3>
<p>Do not be misled:¬†‚ÄùBad company corrupts good character.‚Äù<br />
1 Corinthians 15:33</p>

<h3 id="3-give-into-temptation">3. Give into temptation.</h3>
<p>but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own¬†evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin;¬†and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. 
James 1:14-15</p>

<h3 id="4-love-this-world-more-than-you-love-god">4. Love this world more than you love God.</h3>
<p>Do not love the world or anything in the world.¬†If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. 
1 John 2:15</p>

<h3 id="5-if-all-else-fails-fake-it">5. If all else fails: fake it!</h3>
<p>I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
Revelation 3:1</p>

<p>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.  Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
Revelation 2:4-5</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the worst advice you‚Äôve ever heard about God?</li>
  <li>Do you ever fake it to be a ‚Äúgood Christian?‚Äù Have fun, give some examples, dear brother or sister.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which of Craig‚Äôs five pieces of bad advice were easiest to identify with? Why?</li>
  <li>Why do you think it‚Äôs easy to unknowingly follow bad advice?</li>
  <li>What bad advice would you add to Craig‚Äôs list?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Was there a time in your faith when you felt closer to God? What was different about your life then?</li>
  <li>Are there any ways you love your life more than God? Share.</li>
  <li>Share about an experience when you got out of one of these cycles of Bad Advice. What made the difference?</li>
  <li>Read Matthew <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mat.13.19-23.niv">Matthew 13:19-23</a>. Which soil are you most like currently? How will you mend the soil?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about motives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/isa.29.13.niv">Isaiah 29:13</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.4.7-8.niv">James 4:7-8</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rev.2.4-5.niv">Revelations 2:4-5</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/isa.55.6-7.niv">Isaiah 55:6-7</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p><em>Holy Spirit, we so easily get off track and start doing the things we don‚Äôt want to do. We thank You for providing the power to overcome worldly advice. Will You do a fresh work in our lives starting today? Amen.</em></p>

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
