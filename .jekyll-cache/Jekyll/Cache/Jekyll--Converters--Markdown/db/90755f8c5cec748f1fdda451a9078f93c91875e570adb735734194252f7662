<p class="lead">Think back through Craigâ€™s message. What sticks out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p>ï¿¼<em>The Son of Man came eating and drinking â€¦</em><br />
Luke 7:34 NIV</p>

<p><em>They devoted themselves to the apostlesâ€™ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</em><br />
Acts 2:42-47 NIV</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did your family eat together when you were a kid? Now?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s your favorite food to eat with friends?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you do now that most resembles the kind of community described in Acts 2:42-47?</li>
  <li><em>The Son of Man came eating and drinking</em> â€¦ Luke 7:34 If this Scripture were about you, what would it say?</li>
  <li>Which one is easier for you: community at church or outside of church? Why?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share a story of a time when a community of friends held you
up during a hard time.</li>
  <li>What are you doing right now thatâ€™s causing relationships to deepen? What are you doing thatâ€™s keeping them from deepening?</li>
  <li>Do you ever feel like you have no one to fall back on? What have you done about those thoughts?</li>
  <li>What are some things you do instead of spending time in community? Are they worth it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.6.2.niv">Galatians 6:2</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.12.3-13.niv">Romans 12:3-13</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ecc.4.9-12.niv">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.19.niv">Luke 22:19</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p>Jesus, we get so busy and forget the power of community. Will You reignite our passion for coming together in worship and in life? Holy Spirit, empower us to not just go to church, but to be the Church, together. Amen.</p>

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which do you most lack: consistent community with other believers at church or community with others in your homes? What will you do about it?</li>
  <li>Who do you know whoâ€™s lacking community? How can our group help others to find community?</li>
  <li>If you havenâ€™t yet, read the Bible Plan at <a href="https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/2391-love-like-jesus">go2.lc/lovelikejesus</a></li>
