<p class="lead">Think back through Craigâ€™s message. What sticks out to you?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>While [Jesus] was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</em><br />
Mark 14:3 NIV</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mrk.14.22-24.niv">Mark 14:22-24</a><br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.19.niv">Luke 22:19</a></p>

<p>Broken and Poured Out</p>

<ol>
  <li>Her gift represented her <strong>past</strong>.</li>
  <li>Her gift represented her <strong>future</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼<em>â€œYour most effective ministry will come out of your deepest hurts.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œWhen the woman broke the jar, she didnâ€™t hold back a single drop. When Jesusâ€™ body was broken, He gave his whole life.â€</em></p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name the most expensive thing youâ€™ve broken. Okay, howâ€™d you break it?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s something you hate to see get poured out or wasted?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What point do you think Mark was trying to make by putting the story of the woman and the Passover next to each other?</li>
  <li>Imagine you were in the room when this woman broke the $20K jar. How would you respond?</li>
  <li>Read Luke 22:19. What all do you think Jesus wanted us to do when He said, â€œâ€¦ <em>do this in remembrance of me</em>â€?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you ever experienced the type of brokenness Pastor Craig talked about? Whatâ€™s your story?</li>
  <li>Are you trying to stay strong in an area of weakness or hold on to something you need to pour out? Whatâ€™s keeping you from giving it to God?</li>
  <li>Describe what a broken and poured out life could look like.</li>
  <li>How has God has used broken areas from your past to help others?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus, Youâ€™ve told us to keep doing what You did: be broken and poured out to bring people closer to God. Will You embolden us to really start living this way? Amen.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about brokenness.</p>
