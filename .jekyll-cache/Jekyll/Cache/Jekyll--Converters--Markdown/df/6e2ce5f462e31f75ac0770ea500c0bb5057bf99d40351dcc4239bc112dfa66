<p class="lead">Think back through Craig‚Äôs talk. What stuck out?</p>

<h3 id="key-scriptures">Key Scriptures</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.15.5-7.niv">Romans 15:5-7</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.17.20-21,23.niv">John 17:20-21,23</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.12.5.niv">Romans 12:5</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34-35.niv">John 13:34-35</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.4.32,34.niv">Acts 4:32,34</a></p>

<p><em><strong>so that</strong> with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</em> <strong>- Romans 15:6 NIV</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-pray-for-unity">Why Pray for Unity?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Because we desperately <strong>need</strong> each other.</li>
  <li>Because the world will <strong>see</strong> God‚Äôs love.</li>
  <li>Because we can do infinitely more <strong>together</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>‚ÄúWe pray for unity <strong>so that</strong> God would be glorified and the world would know He sent Jesus.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe may speak different languages, but we worship one Savior!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPeople are sick and tired of hearing about the love of Jesus‚Äîthey want to see it!‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you ever heard our church bad-talked? How can we respond to create unity?</li>
  <li>What hit you right between the eyes from Craig‚Äôs talk?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does your life include Christians from diverse churches and cultures? How could your faith become more inclusive?</li>
  <li>Think outside the box. What do you do at work, home, school, or in your community that shows Christ‚Äôs love?</li>
  <li>If all the Christians who lived in your neighborhood were in ‚Äúcomplete unity,‚Äù how would your neighborhood look different?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of a time when you were a part of Christians showing love in unity. How did it come about? Is it still happening?</li>
  <li>Have you been accepted by others as Christ accepts us? How would you describe the feeling? How can we live this way?</li>
  <li>How can our LifeGroup become known for showing‚Äînot just talking about‚ÄîGod‚Äôs love?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pray for compassion to accept others as Christ accepted you. Ask confidently for the Holy Spirit to give you boldness to show the love of Christ. Pray the local church will become known by our actions, as the hope of the world.</li>
</ul>
