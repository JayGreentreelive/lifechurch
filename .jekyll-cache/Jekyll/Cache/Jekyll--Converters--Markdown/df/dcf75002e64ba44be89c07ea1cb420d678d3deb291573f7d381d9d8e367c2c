<ul>

</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>

  <li>What’s the one thing that makes you feel like you still need to work on getting God’s approval?</li>
  <li>My God is always for me. My God always helps me. My God is still working in me. Which truth do you need most right now?</li>
  <li>What do you think you’ll never be _____ enough to do? What does God think?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holy Spirit will You replace our broken sense of self-security with reliance on you? God, Your Spirit is always for us, always helping us, and always working in us. You started this good work and we believe You’ll be faithful to complete it. Amen.</li>
