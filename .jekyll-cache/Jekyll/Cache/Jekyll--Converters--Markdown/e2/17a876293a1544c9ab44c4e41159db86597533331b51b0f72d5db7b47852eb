<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI have the right to do anything,‚Äù you say‚Äîbut not everything is beneficial.¬†‚ÄúI have the right to do anything‚Äù‚Äîbut I will not be mastered by anything.</em></p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It seems like everyone has a go-to comfort food. What‚Äôs yours?</li>
  <li>Do you ever binge on shows, games, or even books? How do you feel after?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which of Craig‚Äôs four pieces of bad advice sounds the worst to you? Why?</li>
  <li>Read 2 Corinthians 10:3-5. Do you think you have divine power to demolish strongholds? How do you think this should apply to believers?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reflect on 1 Corinthians 6:12. Are you over-spending your time, energy, or other resources on anything that‚Äôs not beneficial? Why?</li>
  <li>Have you ever become addicted to something? How did it start?</li>
  <li>Have you ever been set free from something by the power of God? Can you share that story?</li>
  <li>Read <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.5.1.niv">Galations 5:1</a> We believe Jesus sets us free. Let‚Äôs pray together for freedom. What can we pray about?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about motives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.5.1.niv">Galations 5:1</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.118.5.niv">Psalm 118:8</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.31-36.niv">John 8:31-16</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.8.1-4.niv">Romans 8:1-4</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p><em>God, when You speak, things happen. You also gave us the power to speak and demolish strongholds. So we‚Äôre talking to You now and asking You to set us free from empty obsessions. In the name of Jesus, amen.</em></p>
