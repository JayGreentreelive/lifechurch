<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craigâ€™s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.97.12.niv">Psalm 97:12</a></p>

<p>###The Theology of Happiness
Whatever makes me happy must be <strong>right</strong>. Whatever makes me unhappy must be <strong>wrong</strong>.<br />
Discomfort, delay, risk, suffering, inconveniences, and obstacles canâ€™t be <strong>Godâ€™s</strong> will.<br />
Without knowing it, I begin to <strong>worship</strong> the false gods of comfort, money, pleasure, and things.</p>

<p>###God Doesnâ€™t Want You Happy</p>
<ul>
  <li>When it causes you to do something <strong>wrong</strong> or <strong>unwise</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.1.15.niv">1 Peter 1:15</a></li>
  <li>When it is only based on things of this <strong>world</strong>.<br />
Better possessions + peaceful circumstances + thrilling experiences + the right relationships + the perfect appearance = happiness.<br />

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If God really were a cosmic soda machine, which drink would you be?</li>
  <li>What are some things that just plain make you happy?</li>
  <li>What does culture say you need to be happy?</li>
  <li>How much of your day do you spend seeking out things that make you happy?</li>
  <li>If God doesnâ€™t just want you happy, then what does He want?</li>
  <li>Read Proverbs 14:2. Think of a time you did something wrong or unwise in pursuit of happiness. Are you currently being tempted to do something wrong or unwise?</li>
  <li>What are some mini-gods in your lifeâ€”stuff, perfection, having your way, control, feeling good?</li>
  <li>What is the scariest part about replacing the pursuit of happiness with the pursuit of God?</li>
  <li>List out loud some of the things in your life you think you should value higher than happiness?</li>
  <li>Read Psalm 37:1-7. Think about how you delight in the Lord. How have you experienced the blessings of God even when life isnâ€™t going the way you want?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you counting on something in the future like a job, spouse, house, or education to make life better? What step will you take this week to put your hope in Christ instead?</li>
  <li>Choose 1-2 things that youâ€™ve been putting in front of God and skip them for a week. Replace them with time with God.</li>
  <li>As a group, how can we model to each other what it looks like to delight in God instead of just pursuing happiness?</li>
</ul>
