<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you ever noticed the arrow in the FedEx logo?</li>
  <li>What were some “Aha!” moments during Sam’s talk?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you made a connection between love and wise decision-making before? What do you think about this connection?</li>
  <li>What is agape love? How would experiencing it allow you to discern what is best?</li>
  <li>Love is not what God does, it’s who He is. What can you do to get to know Him this way?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On a scale from “hardly ever” to “all the time,” how often do you seek God in your decisions? How do you seek Him?</li>
  <li>Tell a story of a time when you sought God for His best and He answered. Did His answer surprise you?</li>
  <li>Are you weighing any decisions our LifeGroup can offer Godly counsel to?</li>
  <li>What are some anchor verses you go to for direction?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pray that you will get to know God more closely. Ask Him to reveal His love to you. Pray that you will be transformed by His love and your eyes will be opened to knowledge and insight.</li>
</ul>
