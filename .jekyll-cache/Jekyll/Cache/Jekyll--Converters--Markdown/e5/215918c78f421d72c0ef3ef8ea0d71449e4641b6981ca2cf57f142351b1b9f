<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before this weekend, where have you seen Jeremiah 29:11? How did it make you feel?</li>
  <li>If you want to have kids or already have kids, what kinds of plans do you have for them?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How has your perspective of God been impacted by this message?</li>
  <li>Why do you think we like to read Jeremiah 29:11 without context?</li>
  <li>Would you rather serve a God whose plans always line up with your plans or who promises to be with you when you call on Him. Explain your answer.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share about a time when God revealed Himself to you in the middle of a trial.</li>
  <li>Pastor Craig talked about the danger of ‚Äúfalse good news.‚Äù Have you ever clung to the wrong version of the Gospel. What happened?</li>
  <li>What plans do you have for God that you need to swap with His plans for you?</li>
  <li>What are you up against that you need to see God‚Äôs good plans in? Pray together for God to reveal Himself to you this week.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>God, we‚Äôve gotten too good at putting our words in Your mouth. Forgive us for putting our plans ahead of Yours. Will You instead put Your words in our hearts? Will You reveal Yourself to us this week as we seek out and live out Your good news for the world?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pray daily for God to reveal Himself to you and one other person you choose to pray for.</li>
