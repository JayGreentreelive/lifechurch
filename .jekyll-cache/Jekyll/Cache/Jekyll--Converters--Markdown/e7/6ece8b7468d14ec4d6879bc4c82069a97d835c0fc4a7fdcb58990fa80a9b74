<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">How far do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to tailor the discussion to suit your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s the craziest/funniest thing you’ve heard following the phrase, “The Lord told me”?</li>
  <li>Tell a story of when God spoke direction into your life. Did it make sense right away? How did you realize it was God?</li>
  <li>Do you lean on your senses or on God’s promises? What comforts would you have to give up to rely more on God?</li>
  <li>Is God whispering any warnings to you that could keep you out of a storm?</li>
  <li>Are any parts of your life drifting on autopilot or run aground like Paul’s ship?</li>
  <li>Is God asking you to abandon something that’s sinking you?</li>
  <li>How will the storm you’re facing now change the way you face a storm later?</li>
  <li>Are you worshipping the way you want God to do it, or the God who said He would do it? Discuss how to practically live out the latter.</li>
  <li>What would you have to give up to take advantage of a “but now” do-over?</li>
</ul>

  <li>Do you need to obey a warning, discard cargo, abandon ship, or take a do-over to swim to shore? Share what you’re facing and pray together.</li>
  <li>Take responsibility for your spirit with this 10-day Bible reading plan: <a href="https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/1336-my-spirit-my-responsibility">go2.lc/responsibility</a></li>
  <li>Practice hearing and obeying whispers from the Holy Spirit this week. Text each other with stories of obedience.</li>
