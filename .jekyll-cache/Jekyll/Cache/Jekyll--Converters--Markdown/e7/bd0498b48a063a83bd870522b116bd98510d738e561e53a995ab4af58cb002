<ul>
  <li>How do you feel about two-year-olds? When they‚Äôre acting two in public, do you judge their parents?</li>
  <li>Did you picture Jesus being a newborn when the wise men came? Share your craziest encounter with a toddler.</li>
  <li>How worshipful would you say your Christmas season has been? What would you like to do differently next Christmas?</li>
  <li>Have you ever fallen to your knees? What emotions or situations led you to that response?</li>
  <li>In what settings does kneeling seem fitting in our culture (other than with a ring in your pocket or a football in hand)?</li>
  <li>What do you need to surrender to God? What will you do to ‚Äútap out‚Äù and demonstrate that submission?</li>
  <li>In what ways are you still the lord of your life? What steps would you need to take to fully submit to His Lordship?</li>
  <li>‚ÄúYou can kneel now, or you can kneel later.‚Äù What do you imagine your face-to-face meeting with Jesus will be like?</li>
