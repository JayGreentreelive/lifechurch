<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you remember the first time you realized people were different colors? What happened?</li>
  <li>Have you ever experienced any kind of racism? How did you handle it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read James 2:9. How have you and your culture favored some people over others?</li>
  <li>Craig talked about how racism is a sin issue, not a skin issue. Why do you think racism is at odds with God‚Äôs ways?</li>
  <li>There is no racism gene. So where does it come from? How do you combat it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are some prejudices (racial or otherwise) you‚Äôve recognized in yourself? What will you do with them?</li>
  <li>Share an experience that helped you understand things from the perspective of another race.</li>
  <li>Racism isn‚Äôt just what we do‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs what we don‚Äôt do. Are you withholding from people who are different from you? What would it look like to do the opposite?</li>
  <li>The Good Samaritan had to cross a literal street and a racial divide to love his neighbor. What barriers will you cross?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about racial equality.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.10.12.niv">Romans 10:12</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.10.34-35.niv">Acts 10:34-35</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/col.3.11.niv">Colossians 3:11</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34-35.niv">John 13:34-35</a></p>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<p>God, will You break down the racial and social walls we‚Äôve put up? Holy Spirit, reveal in our hearts any prejudice You want out. Give us the strength to love as You first loved us. Amen.</p>
