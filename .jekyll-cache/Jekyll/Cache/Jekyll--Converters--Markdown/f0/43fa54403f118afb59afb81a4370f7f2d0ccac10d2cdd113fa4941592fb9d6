<p class="lead">What stuck out to you from John Grayâ€™s message?</p>

<p>Key Scripture</p>

<p><em>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Phariseeâ€™s house, and sat down to eat.Â And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew thatÂ JesusÂ sat at the table in the Phariseeâ€™s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,Â and stood at His feet behindÂ HimÂ weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wipedÂ themÂ with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointedÂ themÂ with the fragrant oil.Â Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this,Â he spoke to himself, saying,Â â€œThis Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of womanÂ thisÂ isÂ who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.â€ And Jesus answered and said to him,Â â€œSimon, I have something to say to you.â€ So he said, â€œTeacher, say it.â€
â€œThere was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundredÂ denarii, and the other fifty.Â And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?â€ Simon answered and said, â€œI suppose theÂ oneÂ whom he forgave more.â€
And He said to him,Â â€œYou have rightly judged.â€Â Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon,Â â€œDo you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me noÂ water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wipedÂ themÂ with the hair of her head.Â You gave Me noÂ kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in.Â You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil.Â Therefore I say to you, her sins, whichÂ areÂ many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven,Â the sameÂ loves little.â€</em><br />
Luke 7:36-47 NKJV</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œPlanting some chrysanthemums?â€ Share a time when you went to a â€œstuffed shirtâ€ kind of event. What was the most surface conversation you heard?</li>
  <li>â€œWe won! We? Youâ€™re not on the team!â€ What team are you most connected to through your passion?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How would your group respond if a stranger were weeping under the table? How should you respond?</li>
  <li>Jesus is worthy of our passion and commitment. How does your life reflect this hunger and thirst for Jesus? How could it reflect that passion more?</li>
  <li>Since â€œJesus is bigger than politics,â€ how does your conversation during the week reflect this truth?</li>
  <li>â€œEw!â€ Who are the kinds of people today who are seen as shameful like this woman was in her time? How can we offer them Godâ€™s amazing grace?</li>
  <li>â€œNo words needed.â€ Does that mean we donâ€™t need to share our faith? What did this title mean in context?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is your own circle too small to include the lost and hurting? Who are people in your circle who need Jesus?</li>
  <li>Since we are living letters (2 Corinthians 3:2), what version of Jesus do people see when they read your life?</li>
  <li>How has shame kept you from growing relationships? What about from pursuing Jesus?</li>
  <li>We all are broken. What brokenness has Godâ€™s amazing grace saved you from?</li>
  <li>How has your past given you the grace to love others?</li>
  <li>What desperation in your life leads you to worship? How will you pursue worship this week?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can we make our group a place where people who need forgiveness feel welcomed?</li>
  <li>Set up an account and send friend requests to everyone in your group in the Bible App so you can grow during the week. Pick an Easter plan and start it together.</li>
</ul>
