<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p>

<p>Key Scriptures</p>

<p><em>‚Ä¶ where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, who with unveiled faces
contemplate the Lord‚Äôs glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory‚Ä¶</em><br />
2 Corinthians 3:17-18 NIV</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.3.14-16.niv">James 3:14-16</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2co.3.15-16.niv">2 Corinthians 3:15-16</a></p>

<h3 id="how-is-tech-changing-relationships">How Is Tech Changing Relationships?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The term <strong>friend</strong> is evolving.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôre becoming <strong>addicted</strong> to immediate affirmation.</li>
  <li>We have the power to do friendship on our own <strong>terms</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-truth-about-veiled-living">The Truth About Veiled Living</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A veil that first covers the face eventually covers the <strong>heart</strong>.</li>
  <li>Only <strong>Christ</strong> can remove the veil.</li>
</ul>

<p>‚ÄúWe have to make sure technology is enhancing our relationships, not replacing them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe were not created to collect followers but to follow Christ.‚Äù</p>

  <li>What‚Äôs the craziest thing you‚Äôve ever seen happen on social media?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If someone you‚Äôd never met started following you on social media, how would they describe you? Is that the real you?</li>
  <li>On a scale from <em>just enough to way too much</em>, how much time do you spend on social media?</li>
  <li>Do you think social media is inherently good or bad?</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you feel addicted to your phone or social media? How does 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 make you feel?</li>
  <li>What are the best things social media is doing for you? What are the worst things?</li>
  <li>Have you ever fasted from social media? What did you gain? What did you do instead?</li>
  <li>Does anyone in the group not use social media at all? Explain what that‚Äôs like.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>God, thank You for making us innovators of technology. Thank You for new ways to communicate and make You known. Will You show us where we need to make changes in our use of technology? Thank You for your grace and freedom! Amen.</li>
</ul>
