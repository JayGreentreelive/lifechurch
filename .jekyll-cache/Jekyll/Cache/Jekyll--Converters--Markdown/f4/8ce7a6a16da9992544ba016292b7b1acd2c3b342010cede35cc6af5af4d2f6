<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What‚Äôs the grossest thing you‚Äôve ever eaten?</li>
  <li>What are some unlikely ways you‚Äôve seen God use unlikely people ‚Äî either from Bible times or your own life?</li>
  <li>Share a time when you saw something really great happen to someone who saw themselves as unworthy.</li>
  <li>What part of Mephibosheth‚Äôs story connected with you? What do you feel like God is trying to say to you through this story?</li>
  <li>Share a time when you were on the guest list of an important event. How do special invitations like that make you feel?</li>
  <li>What was your ‚ÄúMephibosheth‚Äù moment? What piece of your past left you feeling unworthy?</li>
  <li>God says you‚Äôre chosen and invited. He pursues a relationship with you. How easy is it for you to internalize these truths?</li>
  <li>The truth is, everyone is fallen and broken. How would it change the way you interact with others to see them the way God sees them?</li>
  <li>How can you live more like a child of God? How can that truth change you?</li>
