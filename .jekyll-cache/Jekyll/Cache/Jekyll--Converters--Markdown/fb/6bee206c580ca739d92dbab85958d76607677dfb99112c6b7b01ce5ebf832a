<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to make it real. Commit to a next step as a group and bring the discussion to life this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow along with the <em>Pray Bible Plan</em>, and invite friends and family to do the same: <a href="http://go2.lc/prayplan">go2.lc/prayplan</a></li>
  <li>Prayer will give you boldness to share, and itâ€™s a way to share. Ask someone if they have something specific you can pray for. Youâ€™ll be surprised how often people say yes!</li>
  <li>Add a dedicated prayer timeâ€”even if itâ€™s five minutesâ€”to your daily routine.</li>
</ul>
