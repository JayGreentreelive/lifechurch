<p class="lead">Review the key points from Craigâ€™s talk. What stuck out?</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-peter">The Story of Peter</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.54-62.niv">Luke 22:54-62</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.21.15-17.niv">John 21:15-17</a> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.4.16.niv">1 Peter 4:16</a></p>

<h3 id="peters-mistakes">Peterâ€™s Mistakes</h3>
<p><em>1. He underestimated his own weaknesses.</em><br />
<em>â€œAcknowledging weakness is the first step to true strength.â€</em></p>

<p><em>2. He followed Jesus at a distance.</em></p>

<h3 id="what-did-peter-learn">What Did Peter Learn</h3>
<p><em>â€œSuccess isnâ€™t final. Failure isnâ€™t fatal.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œNever put a period where God puts a comma.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œFailure is an eventâ€”never a person!â€</em></p>

<p><em>Peter lost: pride, arrogance, self-confidence, impulsiveness, and unreliability.</em></p>

<p><em>Peter gained: deep humility, unshakeable confidence in God, and unwavering faithfulness.</em></p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h2>
<p class="lead">Where will you lead your group? Pick and choose from these suggestions to create the right discussion for your group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you have a funny story of the first time you remember feeling shame, or a most embarrassing moment?</li>
  <li>How often does shame impact your decisions? Often? Not too often? All the time? What parts of your life are affected?</li>
  <li>Tell a story of a time you failed to live up to a commitment like the one Peter made to Jesus. How has this impacted you?</li>
  <li>What weaknesses do you underestimate? How can you get more honest when you blow it?</li>
  <li>What are some parts of your life you often find yourself defending to others? Are you underestimating a weakness?</li>
  <li>In what ways are you following Jesus from a distance?</li>
  <li>How hard is it for you to accept Godâ€™s grace? What can you do this week to accept a second chance for your mistakes?</li>
  <li>Peter denied Jesus three times, but went on to kick off Christianity as we know it. Have you run from a failure where God would prefer a comma instead of a period?</li>
  <li>What causes you shame today? Yelling at kids? Unavailable at home? Overindulgence? Dishonesty? Bring it to the open and pray together to accept Godâ€™s forgiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="live-it-out">Live It Out</h2>
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to make it real. Commit to a next step as a group and bring the discussion to life this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take out your phone to subscribe to this Bible plan and watch Peter transform from unreliable fisherman to fully devoted follower: <a href="https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/983-all-things-new">go2.lc/allthingsnew</a></li>
  <li>Think of one person you know who seems stuck on past failures. Send them this weekâ€™s message and open up about how itâ€™s changing your life.</li>
  <li>Has someone failed you? Use Christâ€™s example with Peter and reach out to forgive them this week.</li>
</ul>
