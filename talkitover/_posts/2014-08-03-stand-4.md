## Stand In Faith
<p class="lead">Start your discussion by reviewing Pastor Craig’s key points.</p>

This week’s text is Daniel 10:5-19.

_“Sometimes God has something just for you that others wouldn’t understand.”_

_“The strongest of men cannot bear the weight of the glory of God.”_

Three things to remember when standing in faith:

1. God **cares** about **you** more than you do. _“You are very precious to God. Not only does God love you, He likes you.”_
2. God is **doing** more than you understand. _“Since the first time you prayed, God heard the cry of your heart!”_
3. God’s **strength** is made perfect in your weakness. _“Until you understand your weakness, you won’t appreciate God’s strength.”_
