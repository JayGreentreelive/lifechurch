## Relationships
<p class="lead">Start your discussion by reviewing Pastor Craig’s key points.</p>

[John 13:34-35](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34-35.niv)

How technology is changing relationships:

1. The term **friend** is evolving.
2. We're becoming **addicted** to immediate affirmation.
3. We have the power to do friendships on our own **terms**.

[Hebrews 10:24-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.10.24-25.niv)

Let's get practical:

1. Be **present**. [Romans 12:9-10, and 13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.12.9-13.niv)
2. Be **engaged**. [1 Peter 4:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.4.8.niv), [1 John 3:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1jo.3.18.niv), [John 13:34-35](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34-35.niv)

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">How deep do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to lead your discussion.</p>

* Start your time with everyone’s phones in the middle of the room. Talk about any anxiety or compulsions you experience being untethered to your device.
* What’s the dumbest thing you’re into online?
* From Pinterest to World of Warcraft, what’s your biggest technology distraction?
* What does the word “friend” mean to you? What are the different ways you use that term?
* In what ways might technology change how you connect here in your LifeGroup relationships?
* Share a time when you got a text or saw a post that was exactly what you needed at that moment. How can you do a better job of using technology to engage with others?
* How have you used technology to connect to someone in a positive, meaningful way?
* What are some signs that you may be addicted to immediate affirmation?
* Would your online friends know you’re a disciple of Christ like [John 13:35](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.35.niv) describes? How can you show who Christ is to you besides just giving Jesus a shout-out in your profile?
* How can our LifeGroup be a better expression of [Hebrews 10:24-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.10.24-25.niv)? What can we do to make that true of our relationships?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Choose a closing question to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What will you do this week to practice the power of presence?
* Who do you need to “really love” this week? How will you live out what [Romans 12:9-10, and 13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.12.9-13.niv) and [John 13:34](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34.niv) describe?
