## Rest

_"Like money, social media is a great servant but a terrible master.”_ Carey Nieuwhof

[1 Corinthians 6:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.6.12.niv)

**58**% don’t go one waking hour without checking their phone. 

**59**% check email as it comes in and **89**% check it daily on vacation.

**80**% of teenagers sleep with their phones.

**84**% believe they couldn’t go one day without their phones.

* God has a special rest in Christ.

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">How deep do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to lead your discussion.</p>

* Put your hands up: Who sleeps with your phone? Who checks email on vacation? Who looks at social media first thing every morning? Last thing of the day? While you’re driving? Posts from the bathroom?
* Maybe you haven’t written a song about it, but describe your love/hate relationship with technology in a few phrases.
* On a scale of 1 to 10, how addicted are you to technology and why? 
* Which app, game, or form of media is the biggest problem for you? What about it makes you admit it’s a problem?
* What are some signs that technology is your master?
* How has the amount of time you spend staring at your phone or computer affected your relationships with the people around you in real life?
* How much time do you think is healthy for you to spend on your phone daily? 
* How would you feel if you skipped all online media for a day? A week? A year?
* What are some signs that you aren’t experiencing the kind of rest God wants you to?
* Is “stillness” even something you want? What would you give up to get it? Why might you avoid being still?
* What is a good defensive plan for you and those you love to overcome or prevent an addiction to technology?
* What is a good offensive plan to seek God first in your life?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Choose a closing question to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What actions will you take to seek true rest from Christ?
* What change will you make this week to get rest for your soul?
* What steps will you take to “do your best to enter into His rest”?
