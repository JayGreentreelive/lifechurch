## Embrace Your Place
<p class="lead">Start by reviewing this week’s key points.</p>

[1 Corinthians 12:12-27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.12.12-27.niv)

* A position is not a place.

[1 Samuel 16:11-13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1sa.16.11-13.niv) 

[Exodus 3:2](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/exo.3.2.niv)

* What happens when you are in place?

_"God is preparing you for what He has prepared for you."_

_“He is doing a work in you to do a work through you.”_

_“Sometimes you have to be in a position you do not want to be to end up in the place you are destined to be.”_

_“It’s better to be marked by God than to be marketed by people.”_

_“Just stay in place—your break through is coming!"_

_“The thing of which I am a part is greater than any part I play.”_

* Go around and let each person share where they currently serve in the church.
* In what ways have you felt like you don’t matter in our church? How does the truth in this message change that for you?
* What is your place in our church? To what degree have you fully embraced your place?
* What are some gifts you know God placed in you to use in His house?
* If you’re not currently serving at the church, what are the obstacles you feel are keeping you from that commitment?
