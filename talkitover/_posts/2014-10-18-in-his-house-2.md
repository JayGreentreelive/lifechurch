## Highly Unlikely
<p class="lead">Start by reviewing this week’s key points from the message.</p>

The Widow of Zarephath

[1 Kings 17:8-16](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1ki.17.8-16.niv)

_"The most barren place can bear the seeds of the most unlikely result."_

_"If you don’t embrace your place here you’ll never do it there."_

God has given you: 

* Time
* Talent
* Tongue
* Treasure

_"Wherever you are now is where God wants you to sow your time, talent, tongue, and treasure."_

_“She was so busy looking at what she didn’t have, she forgot to see what she did have — the ingredients of a miracle.”_

_“God’s looking for availability not ability.”_

_“God still goes to unlikely places, still uses unlikely people, still implements unlikely strategies, and still produces unlikely outcomes.”_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">How can you best facilitate discussion that will be engaging for everyone? Choose from these suggestions to lead each person in your group to own their own growth.</p>

* Vote for who can do the best Christine Caine impersonation. Who can say as many words per minute as she can?
* Are you the kind of person who focuses on what you don’t have or what you do have? Share an example.
* Share something you’ve seen God do around you recently that was highly unlikely.
* What miracle are you living in the middle of that you don’t often recognize?
* What are some things you do have that you believe God could use in His house to do His work?
* Share a time when you allowed a scarcity mentality to dictate how you acted. Then share a time when you acted from an abundance mindset.
* How have you or your family and friends been blessed by other people who have planted their time, talent, tongue, or treasure in our church?
* Of the four T-words, which one are you most generous with? Which one do you need to plant more of?
* What obstacles (or maybe just excuses) are keeping you from planting what you have here in His house?
