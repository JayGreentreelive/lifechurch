## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Facilitate discussion that engages everyone. Choose questions that will lead each person to own their own growth.</p>

* Which season is your favorite (like the actual weather)?
* What season are you in (like the seasons Craig described)? How can you embrace the season you’re in?
* What do you need to pursue or protect?
* What are your experiences with relational intimacy (meaning complete transparency) Craig talked about? Why do you think that kind of closeness is harder for some people than others?
* Did you have any examples of a good, godly marriage when you were growing up? How have those early impressions shaped your outlook on marriage?

### For Singles

* What do you need to limit right now — time, talk, or touch?
* What reflections have you had over the past week about last week’s qualities to develop and look for? (Godly character, growing trust, higher standards, consistent encouragement)
* What are your thoughts about marriage in general? What about for yourself specifically?
* What is easy for you to embrace in your current season of life? What things are more difficult for you in this season?
* What standards have you set (or will you set) to help protect the purity of your relationships?

### For Married Couples

* What’s one thing your spouse does that makes you feel close?
* What would take your marriage beyond just sharing space and stuff? What would bring you closer to true intimacy?
* How have you protected the purity of your relationship? What are some ways you could improve that together in the future?
* What does it feel like to know you belong to your spouse? What’s nice about that? What’s hard about that for you?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What will you do to build healthy intimacy with the people you’re close to? What will you do to be truly transparent?
* What will you do this week to get and stay close to Jesus? Share at least one specific action step you will commit to.
