## God-Honoring Sex

LEADER NOTE: Please prayerfully consider what a painful topic this may be for those with bitterness, shame, guilt, or abuse in their past. Contact a pastor if you find someone in your group needs support beyond your group’s ability to serve them.
<p class="lead">Start by reviewing Pastor Craig's key points.</p>

### Four Qualities of God-Honoring Sex
1. God-honoring sex starts before the **bedroom**.  
[Song of Solomon 4:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.1-2.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 4:3-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.3-4.niv)  
_"Long before you make a move, build intimacy."_
2. God-honoring sex is **passionate**.  
[Song of Solomon 4:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.5.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 4:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.6.niv)  
3. God-honoring sex is built on absolute **trust**.  
[Song of Solomon 4:7](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.7.niv)  
_"You are each other’s only legitimate way to find sexual fulfillment."_
4. God-honoring sex is **holy**.  
[Song of Solomon 4:12-13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.12-13.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 4:15-16](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.4.15-16.niv)  
_"Only Christ makes something holy."_

* When was the last time you read a magazine? What magazine was it?
* Which magazine covers at the grocery store make you want to read the articles?

* Regardless of your season in life, what can you take away from the message that challenges you?
* What models have you seen of a married relationship that honors God?
* What does the concept of holiness mean to you?

### For Singles

* What can you do to build a foundation for great married sex during this season of your life?
* Do you agree that God created sex to be enjoyed only by married couples? Why or why not? What challenges you about this biblical standard?
* Tell about a relationship where you experienced absolute trust. How can you build that, especially if trust has been broken?

### For Married Couples
