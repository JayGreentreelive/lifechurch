## Love In Action

<p class="lead">Start by reviewing Pastor Craig's key points.</p>
###Closing the Gap between Intentions and Actions

_"We generally judge others by their actions and ourselves by our intentions."_

1. If you think something good, **say** it.  
[Proverbs 18:21](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.18.21.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 7:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.1-3.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 7:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.5.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 7:7-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.7-8.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 7:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.10.niv)
2. If you think something special, **do** it.  
Purposeful **time**  
[Song of Solomon 7:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.11.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 7:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.12.niv)  
Thoughtful **acts**  
[Song of Solomon 7:13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.7.13.niv)
3. If you want something different, **be** it.  
_"If you don’t like what you’re getting, look at what you’re giving."_  
[Song of Solomon 8:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.8.6.niv)

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an easy question everyone can answer. Then move through the questions you feel will lead your group to action.</p>

* “Ah, just let ‘em soak!” or, “There’s no time like the present!” When it comes to doing dishes, which type are you?
* Have you ever “scared away the fawns” because you shared a compliment that backfired? What was the result?
* Is it harder for you to give or receive words of affirmation? What makes it so difficult for you?
* What are some intentions you haven’t turned into actions? How could you close that gap?

### For Singles

* What big takeaways have you gotten from this series?
* What good things have come out of making changes in your relationships based on what you've learned from this series?
* Is it easier for you to say something special or do something special? Which do you prefer most in return?
* Do you see patterns in the ways others let you down? Explore the connections between what you desire and what you offer.
* Describe how you can apply the say it, do it, and be it principles to workplace interactions, friendships, and family relationships.

### For Married Couples

* What do you find yourself wanting most from your spouse: being pursued, included, thought of, romanced, helped, or given to? What things seem less important to you?
* Brag on the best ways your spouse closes the gap between intentions and actions. Tell each other which ones are intentional efforts and which just come naturally.
* What will you do to keep working on your marriage in the future? What big takeaway did you get from this series?
* Identify some ideas together for ways to put love into action.

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What are some “purposeful time” or “thoughtful acts” ideas you commit to do this week?
* Use paper or your mobile device to create a list of how you can say, do, and be what it takes to “close the gap.” Set a time this week to go over your list and make a plan.
