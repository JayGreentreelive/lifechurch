## The Story Of Mephibosheth

<p class="lead">Review Sam Roberts’ points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p>
[2 Samuel 4:4](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2sa.4.4.niv)  
[2 Samuel 9:1-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2sa.9.1-11.niv)

### We Are Mephibosheth
1. We are **fallen** and **broken**.  
[Romans 3:23](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.3.23.niv)
2. We are pursued by the **King**.  
[John 3:17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.3.17.niv)
3. The King’s table **covers** our **sins**.  
[Luke 22:29-30](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.29-30.niv)  
[2 Samuel 9:13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2sa.9.13.niv)

You may think you’re broken and useless. God says you’re **chosen** and **invited**.

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* What’s the grossest thing you’ve ever eaten?
* What are some unlikely ways you’ve seen God use unlikely people — either from Bible times or your own life?
* Share a time when you saw something really great happen to someone who saw themselves as unworthy.
* What part of Mephibosheth’s story connected with you? What do you feel like God is trying to say to you through this story?
* Share a time when you were on the guest list of an important event. How do special invitations like that make you feel?
* What was your “Mephibosheth” moment? What piece of your past left you feeling unworthy?
* God says you’re chosen and invited. He pursues a relationship with you. How easy is it for you to internalize these truths?
* The truth is, everyone is fallen and broken. How would it change the way you interact with others to see them the way God sees them?
* How can you live more like a child of God? How can that truth change you?

* Who is someone you know who needs to know how God feels about them? How can you share your takeaway thoughts with this person?
