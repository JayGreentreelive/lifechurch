## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* If a genie in a bottle granted you one wish, what would you ask for (no wishing for more wishes)?
* What does worship mean to you? How did this message help shape that definition?
* Have you ever worshiped with raised hands? How did that posture change your perspective of God?
* On a scale of carrying a big-screen to shot blocking, how do you raise your hands?
* Why do we do something with our hands to reflect something in our heart? What are some examples of that in our culture?
* What are some ways you’ve seen God’s love is better than life?
* How have you noticed your mood or circumstances affecting how you participate in worship?
* When you worship God, what percentage is at church? How could you surrender to God in worship every day of the week?
* What are some battles you’re facing? How could you attack these problems with praise?
* What gets in the way of you being the kind of worshiper God deserves?
* Who is someone who has been there to hold up your arms? Talk about what that meant to you.

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* Share a time when you felt like lifting your hands in victory and surrender.
* How can our group hold up each other’s arms?
* What’s one battle our group can worship through together? How will we communicate during the week about any breakthroughs or victories?
