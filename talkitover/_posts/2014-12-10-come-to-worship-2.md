## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* Spill the beans about a gift you’re giving a loved one this Christmas. How do you feel about giving this gift?
* How’s your joyometer this week? What affects your joy?
* Give an example of when someone demonstrated their love for you through giving. What was your “Nolan Ryan rookie card”?
* Do you see giving as an act of worship? How will this message affect your worship through giving?
* Describe what you’ve learned about worshiping through giving from personal experiences or through the message.
* What obstacles hold you back from giving how you’d like to? What would it take to make worshiping through giving the top priority in your budget?
* If you came to worship Jesus with the wise men, what gift would you have wanted to offer Him?
* What are some things others could observe you doing that demonstrate you’re offering your body as a living sacrifice?
* How did you feel about being asked to give at church? If you’ve used the giving app, share how it affects your giving habits. (Text GIVE to 86613 to sign up.)
* If you’ve been a tither for very long, you’ve got a cool giving story. Share how you’ve seen God at work.
