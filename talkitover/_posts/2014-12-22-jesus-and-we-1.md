## Faith-Filled, Big-Thinking
<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p> 
_"We are faith-filled, big-thinking, bet-the-farm risk takers. We will never insult God with small thinking and safe living."_  
### How big is your faith?  
Jesus was amazed by **lack** of faith.  
[Mark 6:5-6](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mrk.6.5-6.niv)  
Jesus was amazed by **great** faith.  
[Luke 7:9](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.7.9.niv)  
### 3 Principles of Faith  
1. You cannot play it safe and please God.  
2. As long as you have a guarantee, you don’t have faith.  
3. To step toward your destiny, you have to step away from your security.

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* “Jesus Take the Wheel!” If your faith is a song title, which is it?
* Traffic lights, parking spaces, thigh dimples — what is the smallest thing you’ve prayed for?
* What’s the biggest thing you’ve ever prayed for?
* On Craig’s 1-10 scale, how did you rate your faith? Share what caused you to rate your faith that way.
* Have you ever had a moment of faith like the centurion in Capernaum? What inspired you to believe?
* What specific fears or doubts hold you back from complete faith in God? What could help you strengthen that trust?
* What are some things you’ve learned in the past when you stepped out in faith?
* In what areas are you relying on a guarantee instead of God’s amazing grace?
* What securities could be keeping you from your destiny? How radical are you willing to get to let go of them?
* What is something that you know is good that scares the daylights of you?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. As a group, you can help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What are we doing as a group that requires faith-filled, big- thinking, bet-the-farm risk taking? What else can WE do?
* Write down three godly risks you’re inspired to take. Post the list somewhere (like your fridge) for the rest of this series.
* What faith-filled step will you take to be more a part of the WE in our church?
* Pick one way to get on board with our faith-filled, big-thinking church. Go bet the farm at [lifechurch.tv/serving](http://www.lifechurch.tv/serving).
