## Spiritual Contributors
<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p> 
[John 4:34](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.4.34.niv)  
###Consumer or Contributor?  
We are not spiritual **consumers**; we are spiritual **contributors**. The church does not exist for **us**. We are the church, and we exist for the **world**.  
[John 4:31-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.4.31-34.niv)  
1. God calls you to serve **in** His church.  
[Romans 12:6-8 NLT](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/rom.12.6-8.nlt)  
2. God calls you to serve **as** His church.  
[Matthew 5:14-16](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mat.5.14-16.niv)  
_“I see a church where people give more than they receive. Where people serve more than they’ve been served. Where people love more than they’ve been loved. A church passionate about reaching the next generation.”_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* Hold the lettuce, light mayo, double shot, extra foam, chrome rims, French tips — what do you like to have your way?
* Whoa! Who else felt like Craig and/or the Holy Spirit was talking straight to you? Share what impacted you most.
* Where did you land on the consumer-to-contributor scale? What contributed to your number?
* What are you _“having your way”_ that you’ll have to give up so you can serve the way you need to?
* Serving, teaching, encouragement, giving, leadership, kindness, prophecy — which gifts has God given you?
* Craig mentioned some heroes — who are some spiritual contributors you notice? What makes them stand out?
* _“You are the light of the world,”_ those are Jesus’ words about you. Think out loud, _“How does this play out in my life?”_
* Share how you have been served and loved by our church. How will you match or surpass what you’re receiving?
* The Bible says we should be known by our love. What are we known for as a group?
