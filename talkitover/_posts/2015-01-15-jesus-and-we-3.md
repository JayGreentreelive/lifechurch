## Irrationally Generous
<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p> 
[Acts 20:35](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.20.35.niv)  
[2 Corinthians 8:1-7](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2co.8.1-7.niv)  
 We will lead the way with irrational **generosity**. We truly believe it is more blessed to **give** than to **receive**.  
Rate yourself on a scale from _“Less Generous”_ to _“Irrationally Generous”_.
###Becoming Irrationally Generous  
[Isaiah 32:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/isa.32.8.niv)  
[Acts 4:33-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.4.33-34.niv)  
_“I see a church where people believe that what we have belongs to God.”_  
_“Giving is not what we do. Generous is who we are.“_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* Share any re-gifting accidents you’ve been a part of. How else have you seen being a tightwad come back to bite you?
* “Never enough” or “always more,” how does your perspective affect your joy?
* Share a time when you felt blessed from giving to others. How does it compare to other things that bring you joy?
* Are you giving more than you receive at home, work, your community, and at church?
* How have you seen generosity modeled for you by others or in your childhood? What stories do you remember?
* Tell a story of a time that you gave more than you thought you could. What was the result?
* Think of someone who’s irrationally generous. Describe what has caused them to earn that reputation.
* What keeps you from giving more? What are you trying to protect when you choose against greater generosity?
* What are some resources that you’re holding on to that you could be giving away?
* How can you make generosity something that you plan for and stand firm for?
