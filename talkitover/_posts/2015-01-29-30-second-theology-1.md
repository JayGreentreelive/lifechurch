* How will you look at the world a little differently after this talk?
* How can you focus more on what’s true, noble, pure, etc.?
* How many Saturdays do you have left with your kids? Grab some tissue, count, and then list ways to make the days matter.
* What will your kids believe about themselves because of what you believe about yourself?
* How much of your identity do you find in your appearance?
* What was your relationship with your dad like?
* What are some ways you’ve seen dads really rock #howtodad?
