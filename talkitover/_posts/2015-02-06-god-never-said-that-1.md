## God Wants You Happy
<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p> 
[Psalm 97:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.97.12.niv)  

###The Theology of Happiness
Whatever makes me happy must be **right**. Whatever makes me unhappy must be **wrong**.  
Discomfort, delay, risk, suffering, inconveniences, and obstacles can’t be **God’s** will.  
Without knowing it, I begin to **worship** the false gods of comfort, money, pleasure, and things.

###God Doesn’t Want You Happy
* When it causes you to do something **wrong** or **unwise**.  
[1 Peter 1:15](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.1.15.niv)  
* When it is only based on things of this **world**.  
Better possessions + peaceful circumstances + thrilling experiences + the right relationships + the perfect appearance = happiness.  
[1 John 2:15-17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1jo.2.15-17.niv)  

###God Wants You Blessed

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* If God really were a cosmic soda machine, which drink would you be?
* What are some things that just plain make you happy?
* What does culture say you need to be happy?
* How much of your day do you spend seeking out things that make you happy?
* If God doesn’t just want you happy, then what does He want?
* Read Proverbs 14:2. Think of a time you did something wrong or unwise in pursuit of happiness. Are you currently being tempted to do something wrong or unwise?
* What are some mini-gods in your life—stuff, perfection, having your way, control, feeling good?
* What is the scariest part about replacing the pursuit of happiness with the pursuit of God?
* List out loud some of the things in your life you think you should value higher than happiness?
* Read Psalm 37:1-7. Think about how you delight in the Lord. How have you experienced the blessings of God even when life isn’t going the way you want?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* Are you counting on something in the future like a job, spouse, house, or education to make life better? What step will you take this week to put your hope in Christ instead?
* Choose 1-2 things that you’ve been putting in front of God and skip them for a week. Replace them with time with God.
* As a group, how can we model to each other what it looks like to delight in God instead of just pursuing happiness?
