## God Won't Give You More Than You Can Handle
<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p> 

###Why would God allow you to have more than you can handle?
* Depend on His **presence**.  
[Jonah 2:2,7](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jon.2.2,7.niv)  
[Psalm 145:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.145.18.niv)  
_"Never let the presence of a storm cause you to doubt the presence of God."_

* Experience His **power**.  
[2 Corinthians 12:9-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2co.12.9-10.niv)  
_"Are you sailing or rowing?"_  
_"Until God is all you have — you’ll never realize that He’s all you need."_  
[Romans 8:26,28](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.8.26,28.niv)

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* Let’s brag for a minute. How much can you handle? Share a typical multi-tasking scenario you handle on a regular basis?
* What’s the most terrible spiritual advice you’ve ever gotten?
* What’s consuming most of your energy right now?
* When you’re overwhelmed, you’re most likely to: double your efforts, eat something tasty, ask for help, go somewhere peaceful, or do something fun?
* What habits can you create in order to make God’s presence the first place you go when you’re overwhelmed?
* What specific weakness do you need to embrace to fully experience the power of God?
* How does it make you feel to think about laying something down that you care a lot about?
* How have you experienced the presence of God when you had more than you could handle?
* What do you think God is asking you to let Him carry?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What’s overwhelming you? Ask the group to help you determine whether to put it down, hand it off, or give it to God.
* Read this seven-day Bible Plan about how to handle worry: [go2.lc/worry](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/134-worry)
* Make your own list of Scriptures to read when you feel like you have more than you can handle.
