## It Doesn’t Matter What You Do
<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p> 

[2 Timothy 4:3](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2ti.4.3.niv)

### Cultural Misbeliefs about Sin

* I’m not a **bad** person.  
[1 John 1:8-9](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1jo.1.8-9.niv) [Romans 3:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.3.10.niv)  
_"Until you see yourself as a sinner—you won’t see your need for a savior!"_
* All sin is the **same**.  
[Romans 6:23](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.6.23.niv) [Luke 20:47](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.20.47.niv) [John 19:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.19.11.niv) [1 Corinthians 6:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.6.18.niv)

### How we live influences:

* Consequences on **earth**.
* Rewards in **heaven**.  
* Punishment in **hell**.
* Since I’ve already **done** it, I might as well **keep** doing it.

[Romans 6:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.6.1-2.niv) [1 Corinthians 10:13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.10.13.niv)

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* Share some “driving sin” stories—we’ve all got some road rage.
* Share some of your pet peeves that might lead to sinful actions.
* Which is greater in your life: knowledge or obedience?
* Is there a sin you’re allowing to continue in your life?
* Share a story of when you let yourself off the hook for a sin because you’re a “good person."
* What choices are you making because you think they’re not really hurting anyone?
* What areas of your life are growing in the wrong direction?
* When you fight to overcome sin, what behaviors help you win?
* Tell a story of a time when you were tempted and God gave you a way out.
* What does God want you to do differently to overcome the sin that has held you hostage?
