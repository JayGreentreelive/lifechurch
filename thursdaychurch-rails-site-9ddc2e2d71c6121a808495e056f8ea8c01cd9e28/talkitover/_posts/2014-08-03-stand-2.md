## Stand Up
<p class="lead">Start your discussion by reviewing Pastor Craig’s key points.</p>

This week’s text is Daniel 4:22-34.

### Two confrontational extremes

1. Some are **unwilling** to confont.
2. Some confront **unlovingly**.

### Prayerful confrontation

Galatians 6:1 NLT

1. God, help me confront with the goal of **restoration**.
2. God, help me confront with **caution**.

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">How deep do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to lead your discussion.</p>

* Which of the two confrontational extremes do you find yourself most often taking?
* Share a time when you confronted another person. How did you do it and what resulted from it?
* What obstacles might be standing in your way of taking a more prayerful approach when confronting others?
* Share a time when someone confronted you. How did they confront you, and did the way they confront you help or hurt you?
* Craig said when we confront, we’re vulnerable to pride, and could see ourselves above others. Have you ever experienced this truth? If so, how?
* What’s one situation you’re dealing with that you’re having to trust God for the results?

* How can our group pray over these confrontations before they happen?
* What relationship do you need to work to restore?
