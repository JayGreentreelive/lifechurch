## Stand Strong
<p class="lead">Start your discussion by reviewing Pastor Craig’s key points.</p>

This week’s text is Daniel 6:1-23.

### Three Truths to Help You Stand Strong

1. When **God** raises you up, expect **people** to pull you down.
2. Kneeling to **pray** is what gives you the strength to **stand**.
3. When you do what’s **right**, you can always trust God with the **results**.
