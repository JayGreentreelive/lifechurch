## Reconcilable Differences

<p class="lead">Start by reviewing Pastor Craig's key points.</p>
[Song of Solomon 5:2-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.5.2-3.niv)

### The Root Causes of Conflict:
1. Unmet **expectations**.  
2. **Self-centeredness**.  
[Song of Solomon 5:4-6](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.5.4-6.niv)  

### To Resolve Conflict:
* I will **respond** and not **react**.  
[Romans 12:21](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.12.21.niv)  
_"Don't try to change your spouse-change you."_  
* I will focus on the **good** and not the **bad**.  
[Philippians 4:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/php.4.8.niv)  
* I will **talk** and not **walk**.  
[Ephesians 4:26-27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.4.26-27.niv)  
[Song of Solomon 6:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/sng.6.11.niv)

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an easy question everyone can answer. Then move through the questions you feel will lead your group to action.</p>

* How are you about navigating to new places? An app or old school?
* What’s the dumbest thing you’ve ever fought over?
* Share a time when an unmet expectation made you a lot angrier than it should have.
* How does self-centeredness play into the things you fight about? Share examples and talk about how it could have been handled in a more others-focused way.
* How aware of your own self-centeredness do you think you are? How could you get a more objective view of it?
* What’s the difference between reacting and responding? Give some examples of times when this was handled well.

### For Singles

* How much of a problem would your friends and family say anger is for you? How do you see anger affecting your relationships?
* Which of your relationships has the most conflict?
* Describe someone who is really good at reconciling differences. What can you do to be better at it?

### For Married Couples

* Kids, money, schedule, work, household chores, or maybe holidays with in-laws? Which issue most easily turns into a fight for you?
* List some good things about your spouse. How difficult is it for you to focus on these things during a fight?
* What’s your impulse in a fight — to talk or walk? How does this fit in to your natural personality? What can you do to make this work better in your marriage?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What will you do this week to restore a relationship damaged by fighting?
* What can you do to build your fighting skills this week? What would improve your relationships in this area?
