## Pour Out Your Heart

<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p>
[Psalm 142:2,5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.142.2,5.niv)  
_"God was faithful enough not to give me what I asked for, but to give me what I needed."_  
[Psalm 62:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.62.8.niv)  
_"The very thing I hated in that season, I can look back and see His purpose and plan for it."_  
As you pour out your heart:  
1. Remember God’s faithfulness in the ** past**.  
[Psalm 42:3-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.42.3-5.niv)  
[Lamentations 3:19-23](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/lam.3.19-23.niv)  
2. Trust in God’s **power** for your **future**.  
_"Push through your pain to the point of praise."_  
[Psalm 102:1-2, 5, 7-8, 12, 17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.102.1-2, 5, 7, 8, 12, 17.niv)  
_"Cry out to Him; He can handle it."_  
_"He has always been faithful in the past, He is good in the future, therefore we can trust Him with our future."_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* If you were poured out into a cup, what kind of drink would you be?
* Thumb, blanky, mom? How did you find refuge as a kid?
* Share some ways you’ve seen God’s faithfulness in the past.
* Where is your safe place? How often do you go there?
* What does holiness mean to you? How often do you reflect on who God is?
* Who do you pour out your heart to? Why do you trust them?
* What are some things that you need to pour out to God? Why have you been holding on to those things so closely?
* Talk about the last time it was just really hard to worship. How did you break through?
* When did you last unload to God? What happened next?
* How do you keep track of what God has done for you?
* Does your worship come from the depths of your soul? If yes, how does that look, if no, what are some barriers?
* Which parts of your future do you need to entrust to God’s power?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* Discuss as a group how you’ll remember God’s faithfulness. Is it journaling or phone reminders? Is there an app for that?
* Make a list of situations that require God’s power. Bring your list to God in worship this week.
* What is heavy on your heart that our group could pray with you about? How can we worship through these issues together?
