## Bow Your Knees

<p class="lead">Review Pastor Craig’s points to remember what stuck out to you from the message.</p>
[Matthew 2:10-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mat.2.10-11.niv)  
[Psalm 95:6-7](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.95.6-7.niv)  
* Kneel in **pursuit.**  
[Mark 10:17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mrk.10.17.niv)  
_"God doesn’t tell us to bow down to Him; He just tells us not to bow down to something else. He assumes we will when we realize who He is."_  
* Kneel in **repentance.**  
[Luke 5:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.5.8.niv)  
_"Jesus never turns away from a sinner with a repentant heart."_  
* Kneel in **submission.**

### You Can Kneel Now or You Can Kneel Later
_"There are some of you who God has been reaching out to for years. But you won’t tap. You need to surrender."_  
[Philippians 2:8-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/php.2.8-11.niv)

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* How do you feel about two-year-olds? When they’re acting two in public, do you judge their parents?
* Did you picture Jesus being a newborn when the wise men came? Share your craziest encounter with a toddler.
* How worshipful would you say your Christmas season has been? What would you like to do differently next Christmas?
* Have you ever fallen to your knees? What emotions or situations led you to that response?
* In what settings does kneeling seem fitting in our culture (other than with a ring in your pocket or a football in hand)?
* What do you need to surrender to God? What will you do to “tap out” and demonstrate that submission?
* In what ways are you still the lord of your life? What steps would you need to take to fully submit to His Lordship?
* “You can kneel now, or you can kneel later.” What do you imagine your face-to-face meeting with Jesus will be like?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End each week with a challenge to take action. Lead your group to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* Going forward, how will you make kneeling a more regular posture of worship?
* What changes in your own worship habits have you already seen as a result of this series? What changes do you plan to continue to make?
* How will you make worship a priority in your life? How will the four postures from this series be a part of that?
